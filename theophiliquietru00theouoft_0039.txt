A MS. in the public library of the Cambridge Uni-
versity‚ was discovered by Raspe in 1779, and stated by
him to be in the writing of the thirteenth century. This
merely contains a portion of the first book of Theophi-
lus, with an appendix by the copyist collected from other
writers. A copy of this MS. is in the British Museum.
Sloane, 715. Raspe states that this MS. is in 4to‚ and
in the handwriting of the thirteenth century.

College library‚ and is also in the writing of the thir-

“ Lombard ” is given to the first book, “Sic incipit
Tractatus Lombardic-us Qualiter 'temperantur Colores ad
depinyendum. Whether the books of Theophilus are
“ Lombardic ” or not, it is an instance of the estimation
of the writer in the thirteenth century. Lombardy was
the pupil of Byzantium, and this is corroborative of the
view I have taken throughout my notes to this work,
that the influenee of the Byzantine Greeks is every
where traceable.
