CHAPTER XX.

OF REDDENING DOORS, AND OF LINSEED 011..

11³, however, you wish to redden panels, take linseed oil,
which you make in this manner. Take linseed and dry it in
a pan over the fire, without water. Then put 'rt into a mortar
and bruise it with the pestle until it becomes a very fine
powder; placing it again in the pan, and pouring a little
water upon it, make it thus very hot. Afterwards fold it in
a new cloth and place it in the press, in which olive, or walnut,
or poppy oil is accustomed to be expressed, that this also may
be expressed in the same manner. With this oil grind
minium, or cinnabar, upon the stone, without water, and
paint over the doors or tablets, which you wish to redden, with
a pencil, and you will dry them in the sun. Then paint them
again, and again dry them. At last cover them over with
that gluten which is called varnish, and which is made in this
manner.

CHAPTER XXI.

OF THE VARNISH GLUTEN.

Ptrr linseed oil into a small new pot, and add, very finely
powdered‚ the gum which is called fomis, which has the
appearance of the most lucid Thus, but when broken, it yields
a brighter lustre. When you have placed which over the
fire, cook carefully, so that it may not boil up, until a third
part is consumed‚ and guard against the flame, because it is
very dangerous and is extinguished with difficulty if it be
raised. Every painting, covered over with this gluten, is
made both beautiful and for ever durable.
