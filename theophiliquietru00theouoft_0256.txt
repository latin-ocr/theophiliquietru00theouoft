itself in the pot, and that the invention we are called upon to
notice, as next in rotation‚ is the method of colouring white glass
by means of a flux, ‘⁴ vitri lucidissimi.’' In c. 12 and 13, Theo-
philus does not neglect the mention of this process, whereby he
tells us that “ the anmn made costly plates of sapphire, purple
and green, very useful in windows,” and in c. 13, he informs us
that the “vitrum clarissimum‚” used as a flux, was composed by the
GREEKS. Theophilus, who asserts that he has “embraced the na-
ture of glass,’' subsequent to his visit to St. Sophia, and his admir-
ation of the effect produced by the different hues thrown upon
the chancel, is the first practical author who enters minutely into a
description of the processes of the glass painter, and, as a prac-
tical artist‚ is the more worthy of our serious attention. The
art of enamelling glass was then known to the Byzantine Greeks3
the statement of the historian of the monastery of St. Begnine is,
therefore, most credible, although attacked by the later French
writers in order to support their pretensions, and the opinion of
the Benedictines‚ that pictorial representation upon glass dates
from the period of Charlemagne, is supported. The art of pro-
ducing a picture by means of gradation of shadow, thereby forming
combinations of light, shade, and colour with the plate of stained or
enamelled glass subjected to this process, was the first and great
step taken in the art of glass painting. It is the process of Theo-
philus, who, however, appears to have entertained the idea of paint-
ing objects upon glass with coloured fluxes, in imitation of the
ornaments upon vases and cups.

That this process was more congenial to the production of ex-
cellence in window work than any other, the remains of church
windows, executed from the beginning of the eleventh to the end of
the fifteenth century, are in evidence to attest.

Reasons for this are not wanting; they have lately been brought
forward with great happiness by the later writers upon the art, and
who attempt to prove that in order to return to the excellence
shown at the periods above referred to, the same simplicity of
shadows and breadth and purity of colour must be returned to.

The care of the painters of these later periods in the taste and
purity of outline is another cause of the excellence of their works.
Outline and arrangement of colour were the points to which all
other considerations properly yielded, in this mode of decoration,
viewed by the means of transmitted light alone; which trans-
