rounded top can be turned, and in the other alike, opposite,
an incision must be made two fingers deep, in which the
round cutting can be revolved. Which being done take the
block itself and apply strongly beaten clay round it, first of all
two fingers thick, which being carefully dry, apply another
upon it, and you do thus until the mould be supplied as you
may wish to have it, and beware that you never at any time
superpose clay upon other (clay), unless that below has become
perfectly dry. Then set this mould between the before-men-
tioned planks, and, the boy who can revolve it being seated, you
will turn it as you may wish‚ and holding a cloth moistened
in water you will smooth it.

After this, taking tallow, cut it up very finely and macerate
it with the hands, and two even pieces of wood being fixed
together of the thickness you may wish‚ you will thin out
the tallow placed between them upon an even board, with
the wooden roUer, as the wax above, water being placed
under that it may not adhere, and so you will immediately list
it suddenly, and will lay it upon the mould and will fasten
it round with a hot iron. Again, thinning a piece of grease,
in the same manner, you will fasten it next to the first,
and do thus until you cover the mould. You make the
rim of the bell of the thickness you please. You will
turn the grease, when quite cold, with sharp instruments,
and should you wish any ornament about the sides of the
bell, of flowers, or letters, you will hollow then] out in the
tallow‚ and will fashion four openings near the neck, that it
may sound better. You then superpose clay, sifted and care-
fully mixed, which being dry you add other above it. That
again being quite dry, you turn the mould upon its side and
remove the wood by striking gently, and the mould being
again raised you will fill the opening above with sost clay, '
and you impress the curved iron, in which the clapper
should hang in the middle, so that its extremities may project
outside. And when the clay has become dry, make it even
with the rest of mould and cover it with tallow, so that the
ends of the iron may adhere well in it. After these things
form the neck, and the handles, and the λίπ’-11016, or funnel,
