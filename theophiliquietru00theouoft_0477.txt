CHAPTER CXI. ¹

OF GILDING COPPER WITH GALL.

ῃ Snomm you wish to gild copper with the unctuous substance

of gall, first serape it with a knife, and then with a bear's
tooth quiekly polisl1it3 and this being done, paintv the gall
with a pencil over it, and when it has become dry, paint it
again and again, and take care that you do not draw the
pencil more in one place than another, but that it be equally
covered with the liquor of gall. Let not what I tell you ap-
pear false, who have proved this art to be true, and have in—
vented it, the God, whose fountain is of wisdom, assisting.

OF THE TEMPERING OF THE STURGEON'S BLADDER.

SOFTEN the sturgeon’s bladder in water until, by bruising it
between the hands, you can make it like a cerate, and then
place it in very clear water in a pot, and put it to the fire, so
that it may not boil, but may receive such heat that, being
liquefied, it may be converted into water. Then strain it
into a basin through a clean eloth, and leave it in a cold
place that it may have aecess to the air, that it may coagulate.
When, laying on the finger, you have pressed it, should the
gluten resist‚ and not be broken by that pressure, melt it at
the fire and pour it upon the gold, and work it very hot, with
tow. But should the gluten grow too thick, admit a little
water and work. Should it, however, be too soft, so that it
cannot retain the impression of the finger, cook it better at
the fire, and you can easily soften this gluten at the fire and
make it firm. You never add gum to gold or other metals:
for whatever, it being hard, shall be gummed with it, quickly
falls off, colours being exeepted‚ which also will not stand well,
unless they are very well ground together and are very thinly

painted on the books.
