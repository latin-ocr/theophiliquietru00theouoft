for picture frames, if fitted to wood, or for ornamenting apart-
ments, &c. A simple lever, fitted upon a tall upright post, with a
weight attached to one end, is the stamp employed3 the other ex-
tremity of the lever is pulled by a rope. Our Birmingham and
Sheffield manufacturers could, were proper designs procured from

our artists, defy all attempts at competition, and re-establish a ne-
glected source of profit and industry.

C. LXXXI. ‘⁴ DE ORGANIS.'’

It will be seen that the Harleian MS. of Theophilus enriches
the archaeologist with three new chapters upon the construction of
the organ, which seems in the time of our author to have been osa
simple construction.

David, in the cl. Psalm, speaks of the organ, which does not
appear to have become known to Western Europe until the year
757, when one was sent as a present to Pepin-le·Bref, by the Em·-
peror Constantine Copronymos.

In a rare Saxon manuscript of the eleventh century,—Cotton‚
Tiberius, B. 6, page 18, is a drawing of the ‘⁶ BUMBULUM curn fis-
tula aerea,” with brass pipe3 also another description of “br'ass
bumbula, with the pipes placed in the middle, three bumbula
placed on every side.” This Bumnnmm appears to be an organ,
which is sounded by withdrawing the stOPS, being, as the organs
of Theophilus, unfurnished with keys. The pipes are of very
thin and pure copper.

In a notice of the “Church of the Holy Cross,'' at Binstead, Isle
of Wight, by Mr. Withers-(Weale’s Quarterly Papers on Archi-
tecture, M idsummer, 1845,) which church is of early Norman erec-
tion, a recess in the wall on the north side of the chancel remains
unexplained‚ as that gentleman states that no traces exist on the
outside wall to show that a sacristy has ever existed there. Simi-
lar recesses are found in our early Norman churches elsewhere,

one in the church at Beaulieu‚ Hampshire, if I am not mistaken.
A probable solution of the use to which these recesses were ap-

plied is found in the 83 C. ‘⁶ Si volueris organa ultra maceriam
muri stabilire, ita ut infra monasterium nihil appareat,'' &c. They
were for the purpose of a proper arrangement of the organ and the
seat of the organist, at that time the chanter also.
