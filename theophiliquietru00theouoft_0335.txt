CHAPTER XLVI.

‘OF THE GOLD OF THE LAND OF HEVILATH.

THERE are many kinds of gold, among which the best kind is
produced in the land of Hevilath, which, according to
Genesis, the river Phison ¹ surrounds. The veins of which,
when men, skilful in this art, have discovered them under-
ground, they dig up, and, purified by fire and proved in the
furnace‚ they subject it for their use.

CHAPTER XLVII.

OF ARABIAN GOLD.

ABABlAN gold is also very precious and of a beautiful red,
the employment of which in very ancient vases is frequently
found, which ,kind modern workmen are compounding when
they add to a pale gold a fifth part of red copper, and they
deceive many unwary persons. This can be guarded against
in this manner: let it be placed in the fire, and if it is pure
gold it does not lose its brightness3 if, however, it is mixed, it
quite changes colour.

¹ In the Wolfenbiittel MS. the river Gyon is by error placed for the Phison,
which “ compasseth the whole land of Havilah.” Gen. ii. 7.
