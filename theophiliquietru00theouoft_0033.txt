PREFACE. XV

But a new impulse had been given to the arts at ἡ
au early period of the eleventh century, Emulation
was first directed to the sciences and literature, which
at that period the services of the church and political
quarrels rendered the most necessary, towards theology‚
jurisprudence, geometry, logie, rhetoric, music or psalm-
ody, architectum, and painting. Dunstan, Aldred ¹, aud
Lanfranc in England, Robert in France, Hildebrand at
Rome, were encouraging the artS, raising and decorat-
iug churches, which the reverence for relies caused to
be ornamented by sumptuous shrines and costly gates
of bronze or silver ². In England, France, and Italy, a
great number of manuscripts, ornamented with minia-
tures and otherwise illmninated, were executed ³. The
ornaments for the Roman altars, desks of gilt bronze,
and objects which ornamented the choirs much favoured
the arts of casting metals, modelling, enamelling‚ niello,
‹lamascene work, and often produced works of surpass-
ing execution⁴.

It is to this period, the early half of the eleventh
century, that the work of Theophilus upon ‘⁴ THE
Dwmzs ARTs'' is to be ascribed.

While Greece was the painter of the continent;
T uscany‚ the enameller3 Arabia, the worker in metals;

de L’Escalopier. It will be seen that 1 have made considerable
use ofit in elucidation of the meaning of Theophilus.
