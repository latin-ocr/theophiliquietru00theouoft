mire the generosity of God, aud I advise them likewise
that if to this their labours are added, they may believe
beyond a doubt that excellence awaits them.

And as it is iniquitous and detestable to a man to
appropriate through covetousness‚ in any manner, that
which is unlawful‚ or undue, or to seize it with theft, so
also to neglect untried, or contemptuously to turn from
an heritage given as a right by God the Father, is to

art, therefore, dearest son, in whose heart God has
placed the desire to explore the vast field of the divers
arts, and to bring thereto intellect and care, that thou
mayest afterwards collect therefrom that which may
please thee, think not thou cheaply of any precious and
useful things3 as if the domestic soil produced them
for thee spontaneously‚ or unsought for; he would be a
foolish calculator who suddenly finding a treasure in a
hole in the ground, should neglect to gather and keep it.
But if for thee the common shrubs produced myrrh,
thus and balsam, or the domestic springs poured forth
oil, milk and honey, or, for the nettle and thistle and
other weeds of the garden, grew spikenard and cin—
namon and aromatics of various kinds, wouldst thou,
these being despised as common and domestic, travel
over lands and seas after foreign things not better, but
perhaps more vile in comparison? this, in thine own
judgment, would be a great folly. For however men
are accustomed to place in the first rank and to keep
f with the greatest care some precious things sought
with much labour and acquired with great expense,
yet, if by chance they are sometimes met with cheaply,
or like, or better things, are found, they are preserved

with a, similar, yes, with a greater care. d
