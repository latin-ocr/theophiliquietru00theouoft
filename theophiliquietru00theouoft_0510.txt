C. LXXXV.

In completing the directions for the services of the church,
Theophilus does not omit the foundry for bens, of which a minute
description is given. Four parts of copper and a fifth of tin form
the composition of the bell-metal. Four openings are made near
the neck, “that it may sound better,—ut melius tinniat ’'—this
precaution is often, in our day, neglected.

CC. LXXXVI. AND LXXXVII. DE CYMBALIS MUSICIS.

The translation of the 86th chapter presents difficulties which
will be allowed by all who consult the original manuscript. I
have strictly followed the text.

This Hebrew and ancient Greek instrument of joy and worship
was introduced into the ceremonies of the Byzantine church.
They were employed at the celebration of the fetes of Cybele, to
whom the invention is attributed. David, in the cl. Psalm, speaks
of the loud cymbals and the high sounding cymbals.

The cymbal was discontinued upon the improvement of the
mechanism of the organ, which, however, still possesses traces of
of the ancient accompaniment of that instrument, one part being
divided into the great and second cymbal.

The alloy of the cymbals of Theophilus is about a fifth or sixth
part of pure tin to one of pure copper.

C. XC. DE FERRO.

This curious chapter-upon iron exposes the ancient manner of
inlaying steel with gold and silver, known to be of Damascus
origin3 this process, as that of the interrasilis, is of that work
which “ distinguishes Arabia,” and which Theophilus promises in
the chapter to the first book.

C. XCII. OF SCULPTURING IVORY.

This is one of the Italian arts of the period, mentioned also in
the Preface to the first book.
