beech-wood below them until they are surrounded by the

flame3 and thus, the wood being taken out, they close the fur-
nace. The same vases can also be decorated in places with

gold leaf, or with ground gold or silver, if they wish, in the
above mentioned manner.

CHAPTER XVII.

OF COMPOSING WINDOWS.

When you wish to compose glass windows, first make for
yourself a flat wooden table, of such breadth and length that
you can work upon it two portions of the same window; and
taking chalk, and scraping it with a knife over all the table,
sprinkle water everywhere, and rub it with a cloth over the
whole. And when it is dry, take the dimensions of one por-
tion of the window in length and breadth‚ marking it upon
the table with rule and compass with the lead or tin3 and if
you wish to have a border in it, portray it with the breadth
which may please you, and in the pattern you may wish.
Which done, draw out whatever figures you will, first with
the lead or tin, then with a red or black colour, making all
outlines with study, because it will be necessary, when you
have painted the glass, that you join together the shadows and
lights according to the (drawing on the) table. Then arrang-
ing the different tints of draperieS, note down the colour of
each one in its place3 and of any other thing which you may
wish to paint you will mark the colour with a letter. After
this take a leaden cup, and put chalk‚ ground with water,
into it: make two or three pencils for yourself from hair,
either from the tail of the marten, or badger, or squirrel, or
cat, or the mane of the ass, and take a piece of glass of what-
ever kind you like, which is in every way larger than the
place upon which it is superposed‚ and fixing it in the ground
of this place, so that you can perceive the drawing upon the
table through the glass‚ so portray with the chalk the outlines
