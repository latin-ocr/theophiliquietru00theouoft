Peter of St. Audemar writes of folium, “ De folio quomodo
distemperatur.” “ Purpureus color quem folium vocant laici, qui
lanam inde tingunt, vel potius Anglici, in quorum terra conficitur,
‘ nuormam’ vocant, non uno semper modo distemperatur. Nam
aliqui cum urina, vel lexivia de cinere fraxinii facta, ut in parieti-
bus praecipue, alii in pergamenis cum visco de caseo, ita facto.”
This identifies the folium of St. Audemar with our “madder,”
which was called “ norma, nuorma or gorma,'’ in Celtic. This
allusion to our country at so early a period is not a little curious
in the history of the arts. The action of the aeid or alkaline sub-
stances with which these vegetable purples or blues were mixed
would of course influence their colour.

The “ morella,'’ was a species of ‘⁶ solanum’' bearing a dark
berry or seed. The turnsol was used for making a violet colour,
the fruit of the mulberry tree, the elderberry, the petals of the
violet and many vegetable colours which must. have been very little
permanent even in illuminated books.

Varantia, Warancia, Warantz or Garance, our Madder‚ was
likewise employed by the ancients.

Dioscorides uses the same term sor madder which the Greeks
of the present day employ, ἔρυθροδανον. The “ rubia tinctorum” of
the Romans and the rubia major of the mediaeval chemists, in
order to distinguish it from the rubia minor, or bugloss, of the
alkanet, or anchusa species.

The “ Hysginum'’ of Vitruvius, which has been confounded by
his commentators¹ with vaccinium (violet) and hyacinthum, (dark
purple,) is the “ alga tinctoria” or “ lichen rocella” of the moderns,
the ‘orseille’ of the French.” Hysginum from ὅσγη, is without
doubt the ποντιον φῦκος of Theophrastus2‚ who tells us that it grows
under the rocks in the Island of Crete, and that it is used to dye
cloth purple. Pliny3 tells us the same thing3 the same author iden-
tifies the purple of hysginum with that of Pozzuoli⁴. “ Quare
Puteolanum potius laudatur quam Tyrium, aut Gaetulicum, vel
Laconicum, unde pretiosissimae purpurae : causa est, quod hysgino
maxime inficitur rubiamque cogitur sorbere.” “ But that from
Pozzuoli is more esteemed than the Tyriam, or Gaetulian, orLaco-
nian, whence come the dearest purples: the cause is that a thing
