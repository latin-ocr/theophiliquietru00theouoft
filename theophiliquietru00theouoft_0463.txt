CHAPTER XCVI. ¹

OF WRITING IN GOLD.

Snomm any one wish to fashion beautiful writing in gold, let
him read what I say in lowly verse. Let him grind gold
with pure wine until it has become well dissolved3 Ι advise
that he should often wash it, for the white page of the book
demands this. Let him afterwards make this liquid, with the
gluten of bull's skin, or, if he wish, with the gluten of gum.
And when he has taken the gold with a stick or pen, let him
stir it, should he seek to write beautifully. But after this,
when the writing has become dry, let him make it very
shining with the tooth of a wild bear.

CHAPTER XCVII. ²

OF FLOWERS USED Fon WRITING.

ΗΕ who wishes to change flowers into various colours which,
in the business of writing‚ the page of the book demands,
must wander over the cornfields in early morning, and at the
rising of the sun he ean then find various fresh flowers, and
let him hasten to pluck these for himself. And when they
are at home, let him take care that he does not lay them to-
gether, but let him do what this thing demands of him.
When you have bruised these flowers upon a smooth stone,
then pile up unburnt gypsum together with them. Thus dry,
you can preserve the colours for yourself. If you wish to
change the colours of these to green, mix lime with the
flowers, you will then see that I have bid you the thing
which I have proved.
