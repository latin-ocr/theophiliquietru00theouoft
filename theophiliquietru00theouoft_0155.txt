ter firmitatem,” and the colours allowed to dry with the wall
itself, that they might adhere, “ ut haereant‚” yet this process, as
it will be seen by consulting the fifteenth chapter of our author,
was widely different from the Italian invention of a later date, by
which the colours unite with the new plaster of lime and sand and
are fixed upon the sursace, yet forming part of the body of the
cement itself. Theophilus speaks of lime, only in connection with
mural decoration. · 4

Requeno¹ thought with reason that the ancie'nts were ignorant
of the style of “buon fresco,” and that the directions of Vitruvius² ¹
‘⁶ De tectoriis operibus’sswere for colouring the surface of the 3
plaster before it hardened. He adds that Wiukelmann and the
academicians observed that at Herculaneum, when some of the
paintings were washed, the colours of the figures, &c., were re- ¹
moved and the even smooth coloured ground only remained. Other ,V
figures were painted with “ Punic wax and oil.” Vitruvius cer-
tainly nowhere speaks of pointing upon cement, although he gives
directions for colouring it.

The passage of Pliny3 “ Ex omnibus coloribus cretulam amant
udoque illini recusant, purpurissimum, Indicum, caeruleum, meli-
num, auripigmentum, appianum, cerussa,” applies to the process
described by Vitruvius.

The phrase, however, os Theophilus “ in recenti muro'’ “ upon a
new wall ’⁹ cannot be overlooked. It is not the ‘⁴ murus siccus” os
chap. 15, but it appears to mean that ‘⁶ fresco” was intended
by Theophilus. How then to coincide the neglect of our author
in this instance with his universal care in description, if “ fresco”
were intended? Theophilus, who promises to teach us all the Greeks
knew in the art of paindng, would not, certainly, have neglected
so important a branch. The Byzantine MS. published by Muratori
is silent upon the subject, Eraclius likewise, as also the writers
collected by Le Begue3 and it was not until the translation of the

Qffifcomss-Moune Athos,-pjtbli·shed by Mons. Didi-on 4,
appeared, that any light was thrown upon it; Theophilus, although
he has spoken generally, has neglected nothing.
