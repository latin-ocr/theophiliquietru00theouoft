to L. I.); and that he was the inventor of a means of
rendering his pictures bright and permanent, we have
at this hour the evidence of his works to show. The
freshness and purity of his colours, and the transparent
medium, which allowed every means of careful execu-
tion, are not to be obtained by the linseed oil varnish de-
scribed by our author, and in use in Italy and Germany,
on the authority of Cennino‚ previously to his time.

Having been too much lauded, the Van Eycks have
lately risked the being too much decried : improvement
in every art is, in something, debtor to the pre-existing
state of that art, and our inquiries upon these being like-
wise naturally progressive, in seeking the cause of the
reputation of Van Eyck, we may again, by striving, to
promote the truth, discover the secret of his success.'>

Paul LomaZZO, an author of credit, has the following
singular passage in his “ Arte della Pittura.'' Writing
of Leonardo da Vinci, he says¹ “Leonardo lta co‘lorz'to
quasi tutte Z'opere sue ad ostio, la qual mam‘era di colorire
su ritrovata prima da Gio. da Bruyyia, essendo certa cosa
che yla· antichi non Za connobbero.” Thus far Lomazzo
follows Vasari: he continues, “ Ora Leonardo su quello
che Zasciato l'uso della tempera pass-6 all’ oyliQ z‘l quale
usava di assotiylz'ar con i lambicclzi.’' He adds to this
that, on account of the bad priming upon the walls, the
‘⁶ Wonderful Battle Piece'' at F lorence, and the “ Last
Supper” at Milan, were spoiled.

Upon turning to the works of Leonardo da Vinci, we
find that the materials mentioned by that artist are
either walnut oil, thickened in the sun, or amber var-
nish and walnut oil ².
