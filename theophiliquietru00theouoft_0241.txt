NOTES ‘ro BOOK 11. 171

teenth century, with a variety of other matters„ contains also a trea-
tise upon colouring glaSS. The MS. is written in the sixteenth cen-
tury, and is a copy from an older work. It contains the following
notice :——“ This booke pertayneth to me John Elyot, which was
written out of an old copye (by William Belyngslie, oon of
the costmers of the port of Bristowe) in anno 1572 ι which
copye seemeth to be above 200 yers old.’'

As this MS. contains the practice of ornamenting glass during a
period of which we have few, if any, records of the art, I have
collected some fragments which may be acceptable to the reader.
