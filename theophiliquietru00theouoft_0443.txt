vessels are turned, so that one column may stand firmly, and
the other can be moved, which, however, when it has been
adapted, shall be fastened below with a thin nail. Adjust
the mould between the columns and both the nails in their
openings, and the strap being placed round the wood, and the
boy who draws it being seated, you will turn it as you please,
and overlay the wax. This being similarly turnedswithdraw
the mould from the handle with the iron, and the air-holes
being placed on, and clay overlaid and dry, cast out the wax
and place it in the furnace to recook, in the above mentioned
manner. And when it has quite glowed inside, take it out of
the fire, and so allow it to reniain until it has become cold, so
that it can be held in the hand awhile. And tin being in-
stantly melted in an iron basin, or pot, a little quicksilver is
added to it when it has become time for founding, so that, if
there is a pound of tin, a fourth part must be (added) of
quicksilver3 and it must be poured into the mould without
delay. When this has become quite cold the clay may be
broken outside, and the handle being replaced, it must be
again placed in the lathe and be turned smoothly everywhere,
but at last it is polished with the rough grass. After this,
take a little of the same serapings of tin and mix with it a
little quicksilver, and you will rub it with your fingers until
it becomes quite liquid3 and thus with a small cloth you
anoint it, about the jar, by turning, until it remains dry and
fair3 the iron being taken out and the inner clay, also, you
dig a small hollow in> the middle of the tin, about the opening
below, in which the iron was, and you join in it a small piece
of the same tin, a little thicker than is the vialâ€š and inside, you
place a round piece of wood, upon which it may lean so that it
may not be bent, and strike it outside with a moderate sized
hammer until it is brought into these hollows and can stand
firmly. You can also otherwise close this opening. Place
the wood into the vial as above, the end of this you wrap
in a small cloth3 you pour pure melted lead into the opening,
wax being also scraped on the same place, and you will thus
quickly smooth it with the small hammer.
