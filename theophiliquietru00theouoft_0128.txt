upon a wall, but is proper in a picture. By mixing a little German
blue and giallorino (Naples yellow) with it, it forms a fine green-’³
He tells us that it is used by “ portrait painters‚’' “ a miniatori.”
The term “memmium” must have been overlooked by the Cava-
liere Tambroni, in his note upon this chapter, when he refers the
arxica of Cennini to the gommagotta (gamboge) of the present
day. Cennini uses the same term in describing minium; “ Rosso
ὲ un colore, che si chiama minio, il quale ὲ artificiatoper¹ archimia.’'
Cennino does not otherwise speak of massicot, which was much in
use, both before and after his time, in Italy.

The Spanish² and Portuguese³ writers, who appear to have re-
tained the ancient terms for a long time, call the prot—oxides of
lead by the name of “azarcon ” and ‘⁶ zarquaon.”

In the Tab. Voc. Syn. of Le Begue, arxica is also defined to be
“ a yellow earth, fit for painting with, and likewise useful in making
moulds for casting copper.'’ This must have been an ochreous earth.

During the combustion of lead in the preparation of minium,
the yellow prot-oxide of lead is produced; this is separated from
the lead by washing and trituration. The massicot, suspended in
the water, is drawn off. This having after a time settled, is col-
lected and dried, and is the massicot of the moderns.

Massicot is a useful colour in oil painting if used alone.

FoLmM, c. 14. In the Tab. Voc. Synon. Folium is thus de-
scribed. “ Folium is used {br dying cloths and is a red colour,
and another kind is purple, and another is blue. There is another
variety which is made by mixing, with the same red coloursashes,
or the lixivium of ashes of elm wood‚ and it is called folium
stampnense, or stanniivense.''

The term Folium appears to include the vegetable reds and red
purples of the Byzantine Greeks3 to these may be added the vege-
table blue colours.

Theophilus does not inform us from what substance his folium
was composed, merely that “folium is of three kinds, one red,
another purple, the third blue.”
