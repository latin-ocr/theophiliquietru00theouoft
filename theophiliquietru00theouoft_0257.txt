mission, while it was found to blend and harmonize the rays of
coloured light before they reached the observer, rendered nugatory‚
or poor, the greys¹ introduced by yet later artists in order to
blend their colour with shadow, or light, as practised in pictures
seen by the means of reflected light.

The fact, as related by Bede, the Saxon chronicler, of the im-
portation from France and Italy, into our own country, of arti-
ficers in glass‚ (Ad). 67 4‚) by wilfrid, Bishop of York, and Biscop
his friend, had an important influence upon this branch of art in
England. “When the work (of St. Peter's) was far advanced,”
writes Bede, “he sent agents to France to procure, if possible,
some glass makers, a kind of artificers quite unknown in England‚
and to bring them over to glaze the windows of his church and
monastery. These agents were successful, and brought several
glass makers with them, who not only performed the work re-
quired by Benedict Biscop, but instructed the English in the art
of making glass for windows, lamps, drinking vessels‚” διο.-

Emeric David states that the English, in their turn, instructed
the Germans in this art.

While the influence of the style of the preceding ages was sens-
ibly felt during the 14th century, the remarkable progress in the
arts of painting and design before the close of that era greatly af·
fected this art, while at the same time the route previously fol·
lowed was not much deviated from. The Florentine and other
schools of art had arisen in Italy.

Stin the coloured and ornamented grounds prevailed, the painted
windows in the cathedrals of BourgeS, Clermont‚ chartres, δῖα,
show that the circles, flourishes‚ and other ornaments of the 1 lth
century, described by Theophilus, yet held their places, but the
subjects were better portrayed3 to the experience of the past was
added the new-born genius of Italy, and the art which the Byzan-
tine Greeks had transmitted to Western Europe approached the
summit of excellence.
