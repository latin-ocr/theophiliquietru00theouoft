01²· TEMPERING MINIUM, VERMILION, AND AzURE.

IF a fourth part of minium is added to vermilion‚ a colour is
procured from it brighter for illuminating and easier to direct.
Which also is carefully ground and reduced into the finest
powder, a little water may be added and it is ground with it
a short time and is collected into a shell‚ the stones are after-
wards washed with water, which is similarly received into the
shell3 this must however be guarded against, that too much
water be not poured in, because it cannot be well ground with
much water, or be gathered together. But being collected in
the shell with water, the shell is likewise filled with water,
it must be stirred with a stick and be afterwards left to rest
until the colour, lying in the bottom of the vessel be separated
from the water, and then, at length, the water may be lightly
drawn off. But when it shall be all cast out, pour the white
of egg into the horn, and so you can work with it.

Blue is to be similarly treated, excepting, that in tempering,
you will admit one third part of wine with the glaire, which
colour will also be fairer and brighter. Lazur is to be washed
in water after seven days on account of its odour, but ver-
milion after a month, twice, or three times 3 this must be
guarded against, that the glaire does not remain too long with
the azure.

Greek green is to be ground in the same manner. For
green earth is to be ground in water, and the glaire is after-
wards put into it, but with wine only. But some pour wine
into a copper vessel and mix the green with wine, they then
leave it in a somewhat damp spot for eight days, they after-
wards expose it to the heat of the sun until the tenth hour
of the day, and they again lay it upon the ground, in its
place, and thus they act daily until it has arrived at a solidity
proper for writing 3 they then replace it gently in a copper or
