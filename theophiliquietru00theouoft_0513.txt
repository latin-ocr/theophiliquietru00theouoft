NOTEs 'ro BOOK 111. 443

calcination (in a close vessel fitted with an upper chamber) of
brass or of calamine, appears to have been the white sulphur of
the Byzantines and Arabs. Both these substances generally con-
tained arsenio, the volatilization of which, with that of the zinc,
would produce a mixture of the oxides of arsenio and zinc; the
deposition in the lower chamber, of a darker colour and less pure,
were combinations of the zinc with other substances, accord-
ing to the nature of the ore calamine employed, and was called
spodium ¹.

Geber tells us that “ arsenio is composed of subtle matter, and is
of the nature of sulphur; it is fioeed by the metals, like sulphur, and
like it is produced by the calcination of the metals :” (is not this
the white sulphur of the Greeks 2) ‘⁸ Therefore it is not proper to
be classed (diffiniri) otherwise than sulphur.’'²

Albertus Magnus, whose writings are in great measure a re-
sume} of the Greek and Arab chemists‚ tells us that brass will
yield arsenic3 ‘⁶ aes expirabit arsenicum.’'3

The θεῖον λεῦκον, white sulphur, was that which produced white
brass: Olympiodorus knew that arsenio gave a white colour to
copper‚ and he calls it a kind of sulphur which is volatilized by the
action of fire. MS. 2250, Bib. Royale, Par.

Richardus Anglicus, who appears to have been contemporaneous
with Roger Bacon, tells us that “white sulphur fixes (coagulat)
quicksilver ;'’ he adds that ‘⁶ there is no sulphur in silver but the
white sulphur.'’ 4

An impure mixture of oxide of arsenio with zinc or tin, would,
mixed with white glaSS, yield an opaque flux, proper for painting
on earthenware.
