PREFACE To THE THIRD Boon. 207

gards the walls, there is the appearance of paradise ; if
it marks the abundance of light from the windows, it
admires the inestimable beauty of the glass and the
variety of the most costly work. But if perchance a
faithful mind should behold a representation of our
Lord's passion expressed in drawing, it is penetrated
with compunction3 if it beholds how many sufferings
the saints have bodily supported, and how many re-
wards of eternal life they have received, it quickly
induces the observance of a better life3 if it regards
how much rejoicing is in heaven, and how much suffer-
ing in the flames of hell, it is animated by hope for its
good actions, and is struck with fear by the considera—
tion of its sins,

Act therefore now, well-intentioned man, happy be-
fore God and men in this life, happier in a future, in
whose labour and study so many sacrifices are offered
up to God ; henceforth warm thyself with a more ample
invention, hasten to complete with all the study of thy
mind those things which are still wanting among the
utensils of the house of the Lord, without which the
divine mysteries and the services of ceremonies cannot
continue. These are the chches, candelabra, incense
burners, viaIS‚ pitchers‚ caskets of sacred relics, crosses,
missals and other things which useful necessity requires
for the use of the ecclesiastical order.

If you wish to fabricate these, in this order you
commence.

END OF THE PREFACE.
