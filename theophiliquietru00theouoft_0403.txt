and other figures of any form or sex, which being impressed

upon gold or silver, or gilt copper, give the greatest ornament
to the places upon which they are placed, on account of their
fineness and labour. The figures of kings and knights are

also made in the same manner in iron, with which, impressed
upon Spanish brass, the basius, from which water is poured
upon the hands, are ornamented in the same manner in which
cups are embellished, with gold or silver, with their borders
of the same metal, in which are small animals or birds and

flowers, which, however, â€˜are not fixed together, but are sol-
dered with tin.

CHAPTER LXXVI.

OF NAILS.

IRON nails are made the length of a finger, thicker at one end,
more pointed at the other, in which also they are to be made
strong with steel, of which one is filed square, another tri-
angular, a third round, according to the size convenient.
Small flowers are then sculptured upon them in the same
manner as above, so that the rim of the iron around the
flower may become sharp. And when silver, or gilt copper,
or brass, has been well thinned, you polish it upo'n the upper
surface as above3 but on the lower you will tin it over very
thinly, with the iron with which windows are soldered, and
you place thick lead upon the anvil and the silver or gilt
copper upon it, so that the gilding may be upwards and the
tin below3 and one of the irons being taken, whichever you
may wish, apply the sculpture to the silver, and strike with
the hammer, so that the sculpture may appear upon it, and
it may be cut around with the sharp rim of the iron. When
you have done this through all the silver, keep all the small
flowers by you, because they will be the heads of the nails,
the stems of which you make in this manner. Mix together
two parts of tin and a third of lead, and beat it out thin and
long, then draw it through the openings of the instrument, in
which wires are drawn, so that it may have a long thread,
