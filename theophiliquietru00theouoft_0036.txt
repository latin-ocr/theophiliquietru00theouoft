xviii PREFACE.

Another circumstance may be adduced favourable to ·
· this opinion. The very few instances in which Theo-
philus affords iconographical description are eminently
of this period of art. In the delineation of the beaten
censer, L. III. C. 60, Byzantine art is particularly ob-
servable3 the octangular towers, the long columns, the
lengthened windows, the circular opening above the
centre column between them¹3 the rivers of Paradise
in human form, the raised arch at the bottom of the
censer, in which are the figures of the evangelists,
whether delineated in likeness of men or symbolically,
are all of Byzantine art3 but in C. 61, the marks of the
period are yet stronger. The figures of the J ewish
prophets fraternized with those of the aposffles, with
their names inscribed above the head, each provided
with their testimonies “ that they may agree with each
other;”² the personification of the virtues, also with
the name inscribed3 the Arabesques; are not only By-
zantine‚ but, if introduced into the West‚ indicat-e, ac-
cording to M. Didron, an early period of the eleventh
century. ‘⁶ The East, where the old law was born, al-
ways remained faithful to its respect for the J ewish
laW, aud the personages of the Old Testament. With
us, the characters of the Old Testament, however ele-
vated in esteem and glory, are not equivalent to a saint,

¹ This description does not coincide with the character of ogival
decoration of the thirteenth century, which M. Guichard and the
Abbe Texier attribute to it.

² “ The Greeks, more discoursive than the natives of the West‚
place inscriptions every where. This is a great advantage. Had
our Gothic ancestors acted thus, we, archaeologists‚ should have
less trouble to specify, or name, personages and subjects sculptured
or painted in our churches.” Didron, Manuel de I'Iconog. Chrbt.
