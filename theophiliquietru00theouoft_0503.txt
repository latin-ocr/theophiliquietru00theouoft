lzave been transmuted into pure gold, ‘⁴ donec ipsa confectio cuprum
transmordeat, et inde pondus et colorem auri suscipiat.''

We have already seen that the ancients were aware of the action
upon metals of substances calculated to produce the mineral acids
in the art of refining, and that the Arab alchemists have described
these acids in unequivocal terms.—Numbers, letters, the signs of
the zodizrc, animals, plants and organic substances, form the sym-
bolic vocabulary of the alchemists os this period. The basilisc,
the dragon, the red and green lions, were the sulphates of copper
and of iron; the yellow lion, of the yellow sulphurets3 the black
eagle, the black sulphurets3 the red lion was sometimes cinnabar3
the salamander, fire3 milk of a black cow, mercury; the egg,
gold; the red dragon‚ cinnabar; &c., &c. Unfortunately each
chemist appears to have varied the symbols in use 1.

The toad‚ ‘⁶ ugly and venomous, bears yet a PRECIOUS JEWEL in
its head,'’² the toads of Theophilus which hatch the eggs, are
probably fragments of the mineral salt, nitrate of potash, which
would yield one of the elements of the solvent for gold3 the blood
of a red man, which has been dried and ground, probably a mu-
riate of ammonia3 fine earth, a muriate of soda (common salt);
the cockS, the sulphates of copper and iron 3 the eggs, gold ore3
the hatched chickens, which require a stone pavement, sulphuric
aeid produced by burning these in a stone vessel, collecting the
fumes 3 these are then all digested together temper-ed with a sharp
aeid. The elements of nitro-muriatic aeid are all here, the sol-
vent for gold.

Geber tell us that the salt drawn from the ashes of a mole will
convert copper into gold. “ Sal totius talpae combustae con-
gelat Mercurium et Venerem convertit in Solem, et Martem in
Lunam.”

² It is not the drowning man only who “ catches at straws.'' 'rho mmd of Shake-

spem· would grasp at and weave a beautiful simile from the meanest object. 'rhat
Shakespear was acquainted with the jargon of the Alehemist‚ who can doubt‘l The
“basilian” of Lady Anne, the “confection” of the Witches, show this, as do the
works of his contemporary, J onson.
