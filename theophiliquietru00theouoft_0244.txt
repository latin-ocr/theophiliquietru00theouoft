fused; this being done and pulverized upon the marble, add nitre

“ Take the glass you wish, and place it in a crucible, or an iron
vase, upon a strong fire, until it is made quite red, and afterwards
throw it into cold water, then withdraw and dry it, and grind it
well, and sift it very fine, and grind it upon a marble until it is
made impalpable. Then place the powder in an earthen crucible
(4-b0.), and put the said glass powder and sal alkali (carb. qs pot-
ash), equal parts, or even Alexandrian Nitre, (di sale nitro Alex-
andrino, Borax¹,) powdered and mixed together in the crucible,
and place the crucible in a flaming furnace, and it is melted, and
the salt will be evaporated and the crystal will remain fused, which

The same manuscript contains the method of making false
gems, the recipes for the colours for which will be, perhaps, worth
perusal. The whole book upon glass manufacture is of interest,
as it appears to contain the processes of this branch of art em-
ployed in our own country at a period when we were inferior to
none in the science of glass decoration, only equalled by the
French, whose monuments have but partially suffered during the
momentous convulsions which at the close of the last century agi-
tated their country, while we have to deplore an extreme loss
effected through the virulence of iconoclastic barbarity.

Itis worthy of remark that these signs which follow, in some
