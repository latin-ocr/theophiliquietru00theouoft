made them quite thin. After this rub them gently with a
boar’s tooth‚ upon a flat wooden tablet, until they become
shining.

Then join together the same pieces, upon this tablet, one
to another, and attach them singly to the wood with wax, so
that they cannot be moved, and superpose with your hand
the before-mentioned varnish gluten, and you will dry them
in the sun. Asterwards take sticks of rotten wood, which
you cut in April, split them through the middle, and dry
them in the smoke. Then take off the outer bark, and serape
the inner‚ which is yellow, into a clean vcssel, adding to it a
fifth part saffron3 and pour over this a quantity of old wine,
or beer, and when it has thus stood a night, on the morrow
warm it upon the fire until it liquefy ¹, and so place in it the
tin leaves one by one, and lift them up frequently, until you
are of opinion that they show the golden colour sufficiently.
Afterwards you will again attach them to the wooden tablet,
varnishing them over with gluten as before, and when they
are dry‚ you have ready tin leaves, which you may place upon
your work according to your wish with skin-glue. And then
take ,the colours which you wish to lay on, grinding them
carefully with linseed cil, without water, and make tints for
faces, and for draperies, as you before made with water, and
you will vary beasts, or birds, or leaves, in their colourS, as it
may please you.

χ CHAPTER XXVII.

OF COLOURS GROUND WITH OIL AND GUM.

Am, sorts of colours can be ground and laid upon woodwork,
with the same kind of oil, in those things only which can be
dried in the sun3 because each time that you have laid on one
colour‚ you cannot superpose another upon it until the first has
dried, which, for figures ², is excessively long and tedious.
