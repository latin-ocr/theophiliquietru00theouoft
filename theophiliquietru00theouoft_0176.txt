106 No'rEs 'ro BOOK 1.

Soccus, c. 14. Suecus, generally, is the green colom· or “ sap ” i
of plantS, to which other colours were often added for a variety of ξ
greens. Tab. Voc. Syn. “ Succus” is ordered to be mixed with '
greens and black for shadow, and to be lightened with'white. “ Suc-
cus” is also, in the same table, described as “a colour resembling
indigo;'’ and “ others say that it is red, darker than minium and
lighter than sinoper, and it is also called* menesch.'' Where, how-
ever, these colours are intended, the base of the colour is named ί
as “ succus folium‚” a purple or violet; for the drapery for which Ῐ,
it is directed is called “ violaticum.” “ Succus Sambuci‚'' a pur· l
ple colour made from the berries of the elder tree3 Theophilus '⁴
directs this to be used as indicum, or menesch, with orpiment.

The following from Eraclius will give the usual process pursued
for the manufacture and use of succus ¹.

“ DE vnum OOLORE, QUOMODO FIERI Possm· AD QUOD vommms
DEPINGERE.

“ Sic poteris viride tibi, pictor, habere colorem,
Cum foliis albam morellae contere cretam,
Hoc in marmorea pariter quoque contere petra,
Usus ad pene liquidum dum fiat utrumque
Et post hunc succum pincello sume probandum.
Hinc quascumque cupis scripturas conde colores
Ne cretae nimium ponas tamen ante cavendo.”

Tunom Ro'runm, c. 16. Thronos were represented by the By-
zantine Greeks as wheels of fire surrounded by wings. The cen-
tre of these wings is sprinkled with eyes, and the appearance of
the figure represents a royal throne. MS. de Mont Athos. Di-
dron. Man. d'Iconographie Chretienne‚ Paris, 1845.

In the church of the convent of cesariani, upon Mount Hy-
mettus, the Trinity is represented in fresco. The Father, as an
old man, the Son, as a man of thirty-five years, the Holy Ghost,
as a dove, are all figured as we are accustomed to see them. The
nude feet of the Father and Son are placed upon a circle of fire,
winged with two wings of flame ; it is thus that the Greeks figured
the chorus of angels, to which they gave the name of Thrones.
This winged and flaming circle is as the throne of the Divine feet.
