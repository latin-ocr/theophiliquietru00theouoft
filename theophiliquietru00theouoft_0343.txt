it, and grind it as before. And when you have put in the
soap, mix it carefully, and placing it over the live coals, again
burn it strongly and grind it anew. Afterwards pour in the
lye, from the first vessel, into that in which is the powder, and
mix it and boil it for a long time, and when it has become
cold, pour it back, together with the powder, where it was
before, where you also put in four pieces of copper, by means
of which the powder may be mixed together as often as you
wish. With this composition gold and silver may be soldered3
but in soldering gold the powder must be stirred together as
mentioned above, but in soldering silver it must not be stirred.

CHAPTER LII.

OF APPLYING THE SOLDER UPON GOLD.

THESE things thus arranged, take those two pieces of gold
from which you formed the handle, and place them before
you, and lay upon them the gems which you wish to apply,
and the pearls‚ each one in its place. Then beat gold fine
and long, and draw from it wires, thick, middling and fine,
and file them with the instrument indicated above, so that
beads may be formed upon them. These being re-cooked,
the gems being replaced and attached one by one, you will
adapt a piece of the larger wire, with the fine pincers, about
the edge of the handle in both its pieceS, and with the cutting
pincers you make very fine incisions around them, by which
you will fix these wires that they may not fall off, until they
are soldered. Afterwards take a piece of gold thin and
smoothed with the wooden mallet, and fasten upon it smaller
wires very orderly, so that they may not be close together,
but may have spaces between them3 at their extremities fine
incisione are made in the thin gold by which they are fixed.
The small vase being taken in which is the soldering‚ agitate
it strongly, that the powder may be mixed together, and with
a fine pen anoint this solder upon the gold and over the wires

carefully everywhere, and place it in the fire, and you will
