CHAPTER XXXIX.

OF CERUSE AND MINIUM.

Bm- in making ceruse, make for yourself plates of lead tliinried,
and placing them together dry, in a hollow piece of wood, as
the copper, hot vinegar or urine being poured over it, cover it.
Then after a month raise the cover, and taking away what-
ever white there is, again replace it as before. And when you
have sufficient, and wish to make minium of it, grind the
same cer-use upon a stone without water, and then placing it
in two or three new potSâ€š put it upon the hot coals3 have also
a thin curved iron rod at one end fitted with wood and flat at
the top, with which you can sometimes stir and mix this

ceruse: and you may do this until the minium becomes quite
red.

CH APTER X L.

OF INK.

To make ink, cut for yourself wood of the thorn trees in April
or May, before they produce flowers or leaves, and collecting
them in small bundles, allow them to lie in the shade for two,
three, or four weeks, until they are somewhat dry. Then

have wooden mallets, with which you beat these thorns upon
another piece of hard wood, until you peel off the bark every-

where, put which immediately into a barrel full of water3
when you have filled two, or three, or four, or five barrels with
bark and water, allow them so to stand for eight days, until
the water imbibe all the sap of the bark. Afterwards put this
water 'into a very clean pan or into a cauldron, and fire being
placed under it, boil it 3 from time to time also throw into the
pan some of this bark, so that, whatever sap may remain in
it, may be boiled out. When you have cooked it a little,
throw it out and again put in more. Which done, boil down
