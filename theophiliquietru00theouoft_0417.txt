the thicker wood a square hole must be made in the centre,
four fingers in breadth, and about which, borders must be left
of the same wood of one finger in breadth and height, in
which the bellows can be placed. In the upper part of the
side, however, small hollows are made, through which the
wind can arrive at the pipes. But the other part of the
wood, which should also be uppermost, is measured out in-
side equally, where seven or eight small openings are dis-
posed, in which the stops are carefully joined, so that they
may have an easy means of being drawn out or restored, so
however, that no air can come out between the joins.

In the upper part, however, cut small openings opposite
the lower ones, which may be rather wider, in which may be
joined so many pieces of wood, so that between these and
the larger, the openings of the wood may remain empty
through which the wind can mount to the pipes; for in these
same pieces of wood openings should be made in which the
pipes are to be made fast. The openings in which the stops
are fitted in the front part should increase, like slanting win-
dows, through which these stops are introduced and removed.

In the hinder part, under the end of these stops, holes are
made equally wide and long of the size of two fingers, through
which the wind can ascend from the lower to the upper parts,
so that when the stops are pressed upon them these holes
may be stopped by them; when, however, they are withdrawn
they may again lie open. In those pieces of wood which are
joined upon the stops openings are made, carefully and in
order, according to the number of the pipes of every tone,
in which these pipes are placed, so, that they may stand firmly
and receive the wind from the lower parts. But in the handles
of the stops letters are marked, according to the rise and fall
of the sound, by which it can be known which tone it may
be. In each one of the stops single slender holes are made,
half of the little finger in length, in the front part, near the

handles, lengthwise, in which single copper headed nails may
be placed, which may pass through the small windows in the

middle, by means of which these stops are drawn from the
upper side of the construction down to the lower, and the
