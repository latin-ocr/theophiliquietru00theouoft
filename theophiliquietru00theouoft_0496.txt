mixture of substances capable of combining, so as to produce them
during the process of refining the precious metals, and therefore
whether they were not accustomed to separate gold from silver, or
other alloy, through the action of these acids, which, attacking the
foreign matters contained by the ore, left the gold pure.

The process, described by Theophrastus, which was employed
in order to procure quicksilver from native cinnabar ΒΥ rubbing
the ore in a brass mortar, with a brass pestle, with ὅξος, has
been remarked, p. 56. Theophrastus adds, ‘⁶ And many other
things of this kind other persons, perhaps, may attain.”¹

Pliny is more explicit, or rather the science had advanced since
the Greek had written, and the prediction of Theophrastus had
apparently been fulfilled.

In the chapter upon gold, L. 33. C. 4, Pliny hands down this
remarkable sentence.

“ Torretur etiam cum salis grumo, pondere triplici misto, et rur-
sum cum duabus salis portionibus, et una lapidis, quem schiston
vocant: ita virus tradit rebus una crematis in fictili vase, ipsum
purum et incorruptum.''

“ It is also calcined with salt grumus, mixed in threefold weight‚
and again with two portions of salt and one of a stone which they
call schistus: thus, the substances being burned together in an
earthen vessel, the bitterness yields it pure and uncorrupted.''

Should the ‘⁶ sal grumus’'² be the sulphate of potash‚ (Glauber’s
salt,) this, with the schiston, acting upon the common salt (muriate
of soda,) with the presence of water, yielded by the salts and alu-
mine, would, under the action of heat, yield a muriatic or hydro-
chloric aeid, called in after times “ the spirit of salt,'’ the gold would
be liberated, the sulphur combining with the soda, alumina, &c.

The schiston was of many kinds, one a sort of haematite, another
of anthracite, but a third a species of calcanthus, or sulphurous
copper ore, from which a schiston was made, called by Pliny a
concrete alum—this is no other than our chrystallized sulphate
of copper ³.

Geber has the credit of the invention of the mineral acids, yet
he writes as if he were not the inventor, but rather the compiler of

¹ Theophrastus on Stones. G. 105. “ Τὰ μὶν οὖν τοιαῦτα τάχ ’ἄνα-ις λάβοι πλείω.”
⁹ Glumen rotundundum, et salvandum quod sal Gemma vocatur, et calcanthum

ex aceto acerrino terunter in aereo mortario, &c. “ Eraclius,'’ vide Raspe, p. 116. ,

Thus grumus or glumen is not “ sal gemma” (muriate of soda).
⁹ Compare Pliny. L. 35. C. 15. with L. 34. G. 12.
