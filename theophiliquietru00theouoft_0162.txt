black colour3 a second lightens the sace ¹. Here the tint pre-
dominates, and the tone should be true. The painter tries the
degree of colour upon the nimbus, which is traced, but not yet
painted, and which serves him as a palette under these circum-
stances.

, “After these two couches of yellow, one which kills the black,
the other which lightens the flesh, you perceive the flesh appear.
A third couch of this clear yellow, thicker than the two first, gives
the general tone of the carnations. The painter has not made the
face “ bit by bit‚'’ but all at once; he spreads a couch over all the
face before passing to another colour. The eyes alone are ex-
cepted3 they are reserved for the end. Then‚ with a pale green,
he softens the black, which he has left in the shaded parts, and
which he had already enlivened with blue. Then, with yellow, he
narrows the trespassing (empietements) of the green.

“This green, which tempers the black, gives the shadows. The
flesh thus apparent is made to live : he passes a rose colour over
the cheeks, the lips, the eyelids, to lighten them and show the cir-
culation of the blood there. Then the eyebrows appear under a
deep brown, also the hair and beard, and then the outline of the
face is determined.

“ The eyes have remained black, under the two first and general
layers. With a deeper black he forms the pupil, and the sclerotick
with white; then a pale and fine rose colour gives the little lumi-
nous point of the eye3 the eyev is lit, and the figure sees.

‘⁴ The lips were only indicated, the drawing of the* mouth was too
black; the painter lightens and terminates the mouth and the lips.

“He then surrounds with a very dark line the entire figure, to
make it stand out. With us, also, at the Romane epoch, a deep line
was hollowed out round a sculptured figure to give it relies.

“ Then a few strokes of the pencil, of a rosy white, are given
here and there, to subdue the vivacity of the red in certain parts
of the flesh3 then a few strokes of brown for the wrinkles of the
aged; and at last a few strokes of different colours, to give the
last touch to the heads and to finish them.

“ Two heads are painted together, as Ι saw Father J oasaph prac-
