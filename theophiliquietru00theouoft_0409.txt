where also you strike with the same irons that the designs
may be raised outside. When you have done this until the
figure be altogether formed, you sculp with the sculping and
seraping instruments about the eyes and nostrils, the mouth
and chin and ears, and you will design the hair and all the fine
drawing of the draperies, and the nails of the hands and feet.
Which being done, if you wish to decorate the crowns of the
figures with gems, enamel, and pearls, immediately work
single pieees in gold with wires and solder, as above in the
work of the chalice, and fitting each one in its place, make
holes through which they should be fastened on, namely,
under the larger genis, and equally in the copper; and you
will thus gild the plate, and you polish it at first with the
brass wires, as above, then with the smooth irons3 and thus
you will colour it, and you fix on the pieces of gold, each one
in its place, and you lay on the gems, and you will fasten the
pearls around. In the same manner should you possess fa-
cility of invention, you can make figures in gold and silver
upon the books of the evangelists and missals, and animals
and small birds and flowers outside upon the horse-saddles of
matrons, Upon golden or silver cups or platters‚ in the
middle, knights are made in the same manner, fighting
against lions or griffins; the figure of Sampson, or David
breaking the mouths of the lions3 lions alone, also, and grif-
fins; the sanie also, each stt-angling single (figures of) cattle3
or other thing which it may please you, and which may be
proper and fit, according to the size of the work.
