TRANSLATION. 233

WaX, and when it has become cold, hold the foot itself
in the left hand, and in the right an iron, yielding and thin,
and make the boy sit near you, who can strike with a very
small hammer upon the iron in whatever spot you place it,
and you will mark the ring with it, which should be around
it between the knot and the foot. Being designed, pour
out the waX, and the foot being warmed fill it again, so that
you may hammer the ring more deeply than before3 and act
thus until you perfect it equally, with its beads. Then file
and serape the knot, and around the foot inside and out, and
its brim ; and make, in the middle of the knob, a quadrangular
opening according to the size of the projection in the upper
vase, and place in it a thick piece of silver, round, perforated
in the same manner. Make likewise a ring separately, which
ought to stand between the knob and the vase above, of the
same size and kind as that which you had formed under the
knob with the ductile iron, and taking a blunted iron you
will rub it upon a flat stone, then upon oak-wood, ground
charcoal being placed upon it, and with it you will polish the
vase inside and out, the knob and foot and the ring, and you
will thus rub it with a cloth and chalk finely scraped, until
the work be made quite brilliant. These things being thus
accomplished, divide the projection of the cup into four, as far
as the middle, with a thin file, and turn it over upon a round
anvil, so that it may hang equally,'and place the ring upon it,
and the projection in the opening of the knob, and the small
pieces which are from above, and holding these with the left
hand firmly and evenly‚ and in the right the ductile iron, place
them in the knob, and cause it to be beaten with the middle-
sized hammer until you fasten it firmly. Afterwards melt the
silver which you have filed and scraped with that which is
left, and strike out a round flat plate with the compass, as
large as is the height of the chaliee from the soot below to
the mouth above, and rather more, and beat it hollow within
according to the breadth of the vase at the top, so that it cau
lie evenly upon it. And, if you wish‚ draw two circles within,
