AURIPIGMENTUM, c. 14. The auripigmentum of our authOr is cer-
tainly a sulphuret of arsenio, the ἀρῤηνικὸιι and σανδσιςάκη of Theo-
phrastus¹‚ the σαιὸαςάκη of Dioscorides ². It was the more valued
as it approached the colour of gold. Theophrastus, c. 89, tells us
that “ arsenicon'’ and “ sandarache” are painters‘ colours.

The native genuine red orpiment, or the sandaracha, was the
most esteemed, the Zarnich-Ahmer of the Arabians, the paler
kinds being often impure were less valued. “ Quod optimum,
coloris etiam in auro excellentis.”³

In the MS. of Eraclius entitled ‘⁶ Liber tertius et prosaicus
Eraclii, de Coloribus‚” &c.‚ contained in the MS. of Le Begue
written about the period of the eighth century, and of Byzantine
origin, “Auricon,’' “Auripigmentum,'’ and “ Sandaracha” are men-
tioned, auricon and auripigmentum as produced in Pontus, (near
the Euxine,) and the best sandaracha also as produced there, near
the river ‘⁴ Ysparin.'' In article 261, this author tells us how they
prepared orpiment for painting: “ Break up orpiment in a skin,
then grind it with water upon a marble, adding to it a little cal-
cined bone, and again allow it to dry, temper it afterwards with egg
for laying upon wood, or on a wall. But upon parchment lay it
as you would ceruse. If not good, mix ochre with it, afterwards
it is serviceable4.

The author of the treatise upon eolours in the Sloane MS. 1754,
British Museum, which is of the sourteenth century, directs the
white of egg to be used, also that two parts of orpiment be mixed
