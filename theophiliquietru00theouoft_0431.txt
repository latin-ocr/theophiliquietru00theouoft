utterly withdrawn, close both openings with beaten clay, to
the proper measure, so that the rim of the bell may not be in-
jured, and supply wood more abundantly about the mould, that
for the whole day and the following night the fire may not
be wanting. In the mean time take an iron pot, round at the
bottom, fit only for this work, which must have on each side
two iron handles, or should the bell be large, two or three
(pots) and you anoint them inside and out with clay beaten
strongly, once and again and a third time, until it be two
fingers thick, and stand them on either side opposite each
other, so that there may be way between them, and place
simple earth under them, and fix them round with wooden
stakes, in two, or if necessary, three places3 where the bel-
lows should be applied you fix, strongly, two stakes equally
wide, and between them you make an opening against the
mouth of the pot, so that the wind can come into it, and in
separate holes you insert ¹separate irons‚ thin and bent, so
that the pipes of the bellows may be able to lie in them firmly3
and thus you make over this pot, with stones and clay, a fur-
nace around it, a foot and a half high, and you line it inside
smoothly, with the same clay, and so apply ignited coals·
And when you have done alike to the separate pots, set the
bellows with their instrumente in which they may lie firmly,
two to each opening, and to each bellows you will depute two
strong men. When, however, the inside of the pot has be—
come quite glowing, cut, to each one, two blocks of oak, dry
and thick, so fit that they may be able to fill the bottom of
the pot inside, and make an opening in the middle of them
through which one might pour in, and upon these place two
other pieces of wood of the same size, and around place a
kind of stakes, from the same wood, protruding from these
blocks above the mouth of the furnace. This being done,
you will weigh all the brass-work which you have, or four
parts may be of copper and a fifth of tin, and you appoint to
each pot its proportions, according to its capacity. Then
going to the mould furnace, raise the covering above and see
how it may act. If it should quite glow inside, run back to
the pots, and, first of all, put in some large coals. Then lay
