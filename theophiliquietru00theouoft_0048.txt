XXX PREFACE.

century ¹. Raspe has sufficiently and successfully op-
posed the assertion of Vasari3 and the mention, by
Vasari himself, of the picture in oil, painted by Lippo
Dalmasio, at Bologna‚ in 1407, is sufficient confutation
of the tale. The passages from Eraclius and Gemino,
which I have given in the above-named notes, are suffi-
cient to prove that the art of using driers with oil in
the process of painting, so as to render the work less
tedious‚ was likewise known previously to the time of
Van Eyck3 the opinion of Raspe ², in which M. Guichard
coincides, is not therefore tenable. ,

Α third supposition was started by Emeric David ³,
that painting in oil, having been abandoned in the
tenth or eleventh century, had been invented anew in
the fifteenth by John Van Eyck. This is open to equal
objection‚ as the English authors referred to above have
shown; and it is singular that some of the materials
used for the purpose of painting the chapel of St.
Stephen, in 1350, were procured from Bruges: “the
sum of four shillings and ten pence was paid to ‘ Lomyn
de Bruges ’ for six pounds and a half of white varnish‚
at nine peuce per pound.''

Yet that Van Eyck merely pursued the path which
had been previously trodden, no one can admit who
has compared his works even with those of modern
times, which we know to have been painted with oil
simply, (the more ancient works having disappeared
partly 011 that account, and partly from the class of
colours in use, as will be seen by a reference to notes
