of the furnace and the upper opening through which the
smoke escaped, until it cool by itself. The lime and ashes
upon the tablet are useful for this, to preserve the glass, that
it may not be broken upon the bare (iron) by the heat. The
glass being taken out, assay if you can scrape off the colour
with vyour nail; if not, it is sufficient for it, but if you can,
replace it again. All the pieces being burnt in this manner, “

CHAPTER XXIV.

OF THE IRON MOULDS.

MAKE for yourself two irons, in breadth two fingers, and one
finger in thickness, and a yard in length. You will join these
together at one end like a hinge, that they may adhere toge-
ther and be fastened by a nail‚ so that they can be shut and
opened; and let them be rather wider and thinner at the other
end, so that when they are shut there may be like the begin—
ning of an inside cavity, and let the outer sides project
evenly·‚ and so join them together with the file that you may
be unable to perceive any light between them. Afterwards
you will separate them from one another, and, taking your
rule, make two lines in the middle of one piece, and two in
the middle of the other opposite, small in breadth from top to
bottom, and hollow them out with the chasing iron, with which
lamps are hollowed out, as deep as you wish, and rasp a
little inside between the two lines in both pieces of iron, so
that when you pour the lead into them one piece may be
made. But you will so arrange the mouth into which it is
poured, that one part of the iron may be coupled to the other,
that it cannot slip during the casting.
