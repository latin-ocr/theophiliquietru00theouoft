PREFACE. xvii

very early and incomplete knowledge of their works,
which he had probably heard of in Constantinople or r
Italy¹.

Monsieur,Guichard‚ Monsieur Didron‚ and the Abbe

Texier assuredly have assigned too late a period, when
they fix the twelfth or thirteenth century as the epoch
of Theophilus.
Α It is remarkable, and is a correlative proof with what
has been remarked above, that there is no mention in
the ‘⁶ Treatise upon Divers Arts'' of distillation, nor is
any substance indicated by which we can presume that
Theophilus was acquainted with that art. This, coupled
with the preceding facts, will place our author in a pe-
riod of transition, or among the writers of the early part
of the eleventh century. The school of medicine of
Salerno had but commenced at that period to inculcate
the Arab science, and to disseminate it through Italy.
Had Theophilus been cotemporary with Roger Bacon
or Raymond Lully, as Mr. Guichard supposes, this art,
which would have simplified so many of his processes and
which has added so many materials to art, would have
been noticed. The influence of the crusades, although
doubtless great upon the taste of Western Europe, we
have already seen could have but little, if at all, added
to the sciences. There is no art mentioned by Theo-
philus which was unknown at the commencement of
the eleventh century3 yet distillation, or any of its pro-
ducts, is omitted, although a glimmering of Arab science
is observable in the work.

¹ “ The works of the Arabs were known in Italy before they were
known in France and the other countries of Europe.⁵' Hoefer,
