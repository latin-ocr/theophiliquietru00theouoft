This dome also has a spire, made from the sanie eloth, ex-
tended by four pieces of wood in shape of a triangle, at the top
of which a small wooden ball can stand, to which the rope
cleaves. The bellows and the instrument upon which they

inf-ayl lie, arrange at your pleasure according to the situation

CHAPTER LXXXIV.

OF THE COPPER CONSTRUCTION AND ITS BELLOWS.

Disposn the length and width of the case according to the
number of the pipes, and make a mould in beaten clay, and
being dry cut it to whatever size you may wish, and cover it
with wax carefully thinned, between two rods equally thick,
with the round wood. Then cut the openings of the stops in
this wax, and the hole below through which the wind can
enter, the air-holes with the funnel being added, cover alto-
gether with the same clay, and again, and a third time. And
when the mould has become dry, cast in the same manner
as the form of the censer abovementioned. You will also
fashion the bellows in clay, the wind-issues proceeding every-
where below in the similitude of the roots of a tree, and meet-
ing at the top in one opening. Which, when disposed in
Î‡ rule you have cut with a knife, cover with wax and act as
above. And when you have cast the case, you join, inside,
at the height of one finger from the bottom, a beaten copper
plate, in an even manner under the openings of the stops, that
these stops may rest upon it, so that they can be smoothly
drawn forth and returned3 and lining these stops with thin
clay, you pour over the rest of the case some melted lead
everywhere, over these stops up to the top. This being done,
you cast out this lead and will carefully mark the openings of
the pipes in the stops3 then you will most carefully perforate
in this lead with a thin iron or with a bore. Then you make
the issues for the wind under the stops 3 you introduce these

stops singly in their places, and you replace the lead and you
