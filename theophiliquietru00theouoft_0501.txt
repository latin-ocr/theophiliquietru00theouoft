mechanical process of gilding after the working and polishing of
the enamels or glass gems, a process which, says the Abbe Texier,
is always observable in the Romaic gilt and enamelled work3 sub-
mitted to a moderate heat, sufficient for the sublimation of the
mercury, the “ electra,'’ or glass gems remained uninjured. The
whole process is worthy attention as is the preparation for receiv-
ing the gilding called “ invivare,’' by Theophilus, consisting of
bitartrate of potass‚ muriate of soda, and quicksilver.

C. XL. “ OF COLOURING GOLD.'’

The process here described is calculated to produce the same
action upon the surface of an impure gold as that followed by
submitting it to the action of a diluted muriatic aeid. Atramentum,
or the sulphate of copper, (or iron,) having been partly deprived
of the sulphuric aeid it contains, is again subjected to heat in the
presence of muriate of soda and the urie salts, upon the surface of
the gold to be purified. The result would form a certain propor-
tion of muriatic acid which, removing the alloy it might contain,
would render the gold pure, thereby colouring, or rather de-co·
louring the metal.

C. XLV. DE FISTULA.--OF THE PIPE. ¹

The reed, called also syphon, canna, calamus, etc„ was an in-
strument formerly used in the Roman church in the service of
communion, in order to withdraw the wine from the chalice for
sear of spilling it.

Its use was preserved during a long time in many monasteries²;
at Cluny, at St. Denis³‚ in the ceremonies of the consecratIOn of
the Kings of France 4: now the Pope alone employs it in the cele-
bration of Roman ceremonies.

The Benedicfines, authors of the “ Voyage Litteraire,” describe
a reed, which they saw in the treasury of the Abbey of Corbie:
