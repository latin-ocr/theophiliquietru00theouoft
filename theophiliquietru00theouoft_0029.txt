The ninth century, however, offers the important fact,
in the history of the arts, of the invention or introduction
of Paintin g upon Glass. The Benedictines have remarked
upon this fact, and attribute the period, with every proba-
bility, to the reign of Charlemagne, who died in 814¹. The
art itself is probably of Byzantine origin, as the flux for
colouring a plate or vessel of glass was known to the
Greeks, who were much employed in the manufacture of
the coloured and gilt glass mosaic work, as we shall pre-
sently see. A. fact is mentioned in the chronicles of
the historiari of the monastery of St. Benignus, at Dijon‚
who wrote about the year 1052 ². He states “ that
there existed yet in his time a very ancient glass window,
in the church of the monastery, representing the mar-
tyrdom of St. Paschasie‚ and that this painting had·
been taken from the old church restored by Charles
the Bald.'’ ³ The reasoning appears inconclusive by
which David seeks to limit the invention to the reign
of this later monarch, as such poets, who have at all
alluded to coloured glass as used in windows, have so
cursorily noticed it, that it is sometimes even difficult
to determine their meaning3 the art was neither neces-
sarily, nor would it be even probably, included in their
descripffions, which relate to the effect produced by the
light transmitted through the coloured medium ⁴.
