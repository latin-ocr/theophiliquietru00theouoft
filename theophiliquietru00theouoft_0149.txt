brought from the East. That found in Ger-many is not perma-
nent, it is commonly called ‘LAsmzsmNss and this is the mean
between the Armenian stone, which is friable, and. the lapis lazuli,
which is equal in hardness.’'

Theophrastus, c. 71, speaks of a sandy cyanus, the “ bergblau’'
of the Germans‚ our mountain blue.

The “ Lasur-stein ’¹ or male cyanus, the deep blue lapis
armenus, is most probably the “Lazur’⁵ of Theophilus.

The Persian “ Lazoard” blue, is probably the origin of the term
“ Lazur.'’ Beckmann states that the Persians are very fond of
ustmmarine, but that Persia only produces the blue copper ore,
(the male cyanus‚) and that the real lapis lazuli is found in the
mountains of Tartary in Bucharia, extending eastward from the
Caspian1.

Most> of the rnediaeval writers have confounded the lapis la-
zuli, the lapis armenus, blue jasper coloured with carbonates and
arseniates of copper, mountain blue, the one with the other, and
errors have arisen which even now are to be dispelled.

But there were factitious blues used by the ancients in painting.
Theophrastus tells us that “the Egyptian Kuanos was factitious,
and. that the historians think worthy of a place in their annals,
the king of Egypt who was the inventor of the artificial cyanus.”²
It was the wrong translation of the second sentence in this chapter
by Hill‚ which led to his confusion and his wrongful denunciation
of Pliny. “ There are three kinds of Cyanus,'' Hill has transv-
lated ‘⁶ there are three kinds of this,’' which he thus makes rela-
tive to the ‘⁶ factitious” 'Egyptian kind just before mentioned.
Pliny avoids this error, yet mentions, like Theophrastus, all the
kinds together. The “ Caerulea” of Pliny are all factitious kinds³‚
which Sir H. Davy thinks preparations of blue carbonates and
arseniates* of copper.’'⁴ Vitruvius, however, gives the composi-
tion of the Egyptian blue. ‘⁶ Arena cum natri (or nitri) flore con-
teritur, adeo subtiliter ut efficiatur quemadmodum farina, et aeri
Cyprio limis‚'' διας the different MSS. have both “natri’' and
‘¹ nitri.’' Thus saud, carbonate of soda, to form the glass, and
the colouring matter copper filings‚ were the component parts of
