PREFACE.

 

THE contentions, which during the third and fourth cen-
turies agitated Eastern Europe, and in which Chris-
tianity was opposed to the fading doctrines and practices
of Pantheism, awoke‚ amongst the supporters of either
persuasion, a spirit of research, which was not pursued
without great advantage to the practice of the arts, as
it unlocked the hitherto closed gat-es of the mystic
sciences, which had been the peculiar province of the
priests, whether of Greece or Egypt, the only persons
initiated into the “ sacred arts,” or “ divine sciences.”
The Christian emperors of Byzantium, who had suc-
ceeded their more warlike predecessors of Rome, were
themselves participators in this war of persuasion; the
sword had been laid aside‚ the toga donned, and the
pagans were to be attacked by means of the strife of
philosophy, so acceptable to the intelligence of Greece
and Rome, enlightened at the same time by the spiri-
tualism of Christianity. In the ardour of the conflict
which the last of the pagan philosophers were sustain-
ing against their irresistible opponents, means of de-
fence were sought, not only among the received pre-
cepts of their own sages, but the mysticism of Egypt
was introduced into Rome¹, and in her ancient hier-

¹ Jamblicus‚ a strenuous advocate of paganism, was initiated
into the mysteries of the Egyptian Isis in the temple in Rome.
