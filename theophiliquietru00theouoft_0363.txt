form with their urns, from which may be poured a likeness
of flowing water. In the angles, by which the circles are
joined together, the heads of lions, or human faces, of which
we have before spoken, may be fixed, so that the faces may
adhere in the lower part in which the chains are fixed, and in
the upper, the manes or hair through which these chains may
pass. But if the foot cannot be beaten with the lower part
itself, it is made alone, in cast or beaten work, and can be
placed on with the solder made with silver and copper, of
which we have before spoken. Also the lily, to which the
ring is attached and to which the chains are fixed above, is
similarly made with ductile or molten work, in which flowers,
or small birds or beasts are formed, according to the quality
of the labour below. If this censer be silver or brass, it can
be gilt in the manner before mentioned.

But should any one wish to apply more labour, so as to
compose a censer of more costly work, he can, after this

manner express the likeness of the city which the prophet
saw upon the mount.

CHAPTER LXI.

OF THE CAST CENSER.

TA'KE clay, unmixed and well beaten, and dry itin the sun,
and being dry, carefully grind and sift it. Being sisted, mix
it with water, and beat it strongly, and make two masses of
it of the size which you wish the censer to possess, one lower,
and another upper (mass) which will be wider3 these lumps
are called the “ nuclei.'' You will directly pierce these with
a piece of wood cut lengthwise‚ smoothly upon the four
sides, and will thus dry them in the sun. Afterwards pass
an iron through them, which is called the turning iron, long and
rather slender, which is thicker at one end, smoothly beaten
on the four sides, and diminishing more and more slenderly
towards the point; in the thicker part of this another iron
