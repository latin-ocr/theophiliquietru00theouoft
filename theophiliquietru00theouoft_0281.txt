CHAPTER ΙΙ l.

oF THE WORK FURNACE.

NEAR the wall, by the window, on the left side of the person
sitting, a piece of wood is fixed in the ground (three¹ feet in
length) in width two and in thickness scarcely two fingers,
which, when it is firmly fixed, may have a perforation in the
midst of the size of a finger, four fingers high above the
ground. Let it have also in front a straight piece of wood
joined to it, and fixed with wooden pegs, four fingers in
breadth, and the length of which is equal to the large piece
of wood. In front of this you fasten another wood of equal
breadth and length, so that between these two woods there
may be a space of four fingers, and fasten that outside by two
or three stakes3 and taking clay, not beaten, nor mixed with
water, but newly dug up, put at first a little of it into this
space, and compress it strongly with a rounded piece of wood,
then more, and again beat it; and do thus until two parts of
this space are filled, and leave the third empty. Then take
away the wood in front, and with a long knife cut the clay
evenly in front and on the top, then with a thin piece of wood
beat it strongly. After this take clay beaten and mixed with
horse dung, and make the furnace and its hearth, covering
the wall that it may not be burned by the fire, and with a
slender piece of wood perforate the clay through the opening
which is in the wood behind. In this manner compose all

smith’s furnaces.
