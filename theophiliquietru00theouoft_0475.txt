brother Ξ should the gem be hard and smooth it will be the

CHAPTER CIX. ¹

OF CUTTING GEMS.

THERE are some who seek a tempering for irons, for cutting
stones‚ I have therefore written this art which I have tried,
that skilful artificers may know it also. I took a wild goat
when in heat, and quenched the iron which I wished to
temper in his fat, and it was thus changed to the greatest
hardness.

 

CHAPTER CX. ²

OF ORNAMENTING IVORY WITH GOLD LEAF.

Am. sculpture which ornaments ivory demands leaf gold.
Should you wish to cause this to be placed upon ivory, do
what I point out to you in writing. Seek glaire and the
very clear gummy liquid which is made from the bladder of
a large fish. This is vulgarly called “huso.'' Should you
possess this, cook a portion of it in a vessel with water, and
it is immediately turned into a gum liquor. When you wish
therefore to decorate the sculpture of ivory with gold, anoint
it with this same (liquor), with a pencil, and then, removed
from the wind, lay on the leaf.
