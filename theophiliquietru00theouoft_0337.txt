CHAPTER XLVIII.

OF SPANISH GOLD.

THERE is also a gold called Spanish gold, which is composed
from red copper, powder of basilisc and human blood and
acid. The Gentiles, whose skilfulness in this artis pro-
bable, make basiliscs in this manner. They have, under-
ground, a house walled with stones everywhere, above and
below, with two very small windows, so narrow·that scarcely
any light can appear through them3 in this house they place
two old cocks of twelve or fifteen years, and they give them
plenty of food. When these have become fat, through the
heat of their good condition, they agree together and lay
eggs. Which being laid the cocks are taken out and toads
are placed in, which may hatch the eggs, and to which bread
is given for food. The eggs being hatched, chickens issue
out, like hens' chickens, to which after seven days grow the
tails of serpents, and immediately, if there were not a stone
pavement to the house, they would enter the¹ earth. Guard-
ing against which, their masters have round brass vessels of
large size, perforated all over, the mouths of which are narrow,
in which they place these chickens‚ and close the mouths with
copper coverings and inter them underground, and they are
nourished with the fine earth entering through the 110165 for
six months. After this they uncover them and apply a co-
pious fire, until the animals inside are completely burnt.
Which done, when they have become cold, they are taken
out and carefully ground, adding to them a third part of the
blood of a red man, which blood has been dried and ground.
These two compositions are tempered with sharp acid in a
clean vesse13 they then take very thin sheets of the purest
red copper, and anoint this composition over them on both
sides, and place them in the fire. And when they have be-
come glowing, they take them out and quench and wash
them in the same confection3 and they do this for a long· time,
until this composition eats through the copper, and it takes
the colour of gold. This gold is proper for all work.
