CHAPTER LXVIII.

How FINE BRASS CAN BE GILT.

Do you therefore wish to gild a censer, of fine brass, do
in the same manner as above, when you gilded the handles
of the silver chalice, but with greater care, because silver
and simple copper can be more easily gilt than auricalcum.
It should also be more warily and carefully revived, and more
thickly gilt, also more frequently washed and longer dried.
When it has begun to show a yellow colour, if you see white
spots spread all over it, which will not become equally dry,
this is the effect of the calamine, which was not well purged
and cooked¹, which you will thus remedy. Take soap and
place it in a small clean cup and pour water upon it, and with
your fingers, as if in washing, mix it carefully until it has
become like the lees of beer, and with hog’s bristles anoint it
smoothly every where over the gilt censer. Then place it
upon the coals and heat it until this mixture begins to blacken,
and so raising it with the pincers‚ sprinkle it with water every
where, and thus you will wash it, and you polish it with brass
wires as before mentioned. Which being done, you will
again rub it around with the wine-stone and quicksilver, and
will gild it anew, on account of the heat of the coals which
are more often placed in it, unless by hazard, if it were thinly
gilt, the gold itself may be burnt, and again you polish it
with the wires, and place it anew upon the coals, warming it
for a longer time, until it shows a red colom, and you will
immediately cool it in water, and polish it with smooth instru-
ments proper for this work, and will colour it with atrament,
burnt, as we have before said.
