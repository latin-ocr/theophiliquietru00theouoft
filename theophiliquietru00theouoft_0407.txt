pared gold of the weight of a nummus is then beaten to the
same breadth and length, and these two are united together
with the prescribed gold solder, until they perfectly adhere to
each other, and they are thus beaten together until a very fine
plateis made. This work appears as if the silver were gilt
on one side3 nor can a leaf of such length be so brilliantly
gilt with two or three nummi of gold. From this leaf boi-ders
are made, from the iron stamp, in the before-mentioned
manner. Fine strips are also cut from it and are wreathed
round in spun silk3 gold fringes are made from it for the
poor in the same manner as from pure gold for the rich.

it on each side and frequently reheating it. And when you
shall have relieved the figure as high as you wish‚ take irons,
long to the measure of a palm, thicker at one end, upon which
it may be beaten with the hammer, and at the other more fine,
round, and pointed, which you had prepared for this work,
and the boy initiated in this art sitting before you, hold the
plate in the left haud and the irons in the right, the boy
striking upon them with a moderate sized hammer, you will
design the eyes and nostrils, the hair and fingers of the hands,
the articulations of the feet, and all the drawings of the gar-

ments upon the upper side, so that they may show inside,
