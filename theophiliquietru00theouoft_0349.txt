thickly around the circumference, and that a small opening
may appear in the midst, through which it can be blown‚ that
the heat above and below may be equal. And when you see
the solder flow about, and as if undulating, a third time,
sprinkle it carefully with a little water, and taking it out,
wash and dry it, and again solder it similarly, and until it ad-

join and solder the fellow handle in the same manner.

CHAPTER LIV.

OF COLOURED GLAss STONES (oa ENAMEL).

Wmcn being done, take a thin piece of gold and join it to
the upper rim of the vase, and measure it out from one handle
to the other ; this piece' must be of the breadth as is the size
of the stones which you wish to place upon it; and, arranging
them in their order, thus dispose them 3 first a stone must stand,
four pearls being placed at its angles, then a glass gem, next
this a stone with pearls, and again a glass gem3 and you will
so arrange them that the stones may always stand next the
handles‚ the settings and grounds of which, and those settings
in which the glass gem is to be placed, you compose and solder
in the order above. And you do the same on the other side
of the vase. If however you wish to place gems and pearls
in the centre of the body, you act in the same manner. This
being done, join and solder them as the handles. After this
you will adapt thin pieces of gold in all the settings in which
the glass gems are to be placed, and,¹ carefully fitted, you take
them out, and with a measure and rule you cut a small band
of gold,- which must be somewhat thicker 3 and you will bend
them round the rim of each piece in a double manner, so that
a minute space may exist around between these small bands :
this space is called the border of the enamel. Then, with the
same measure and rule you cut small bands of exceedingly
thin gold, in which you will bend and fashion whatever work
