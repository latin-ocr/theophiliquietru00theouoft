tendrils facilitate the formation of carbonic acid, and thus account
for the superiority of the Rhodian ceruse? Marble is now used
for a like purpose in—Holland.

The Byzantine MS. published by Muratori ¹, and which he
resers to the eighth century, gives the same receipt for making
“ white lead‚” “ De composition psimitthin.”

Thus, no alteration in the manufactum of white lead had been
attempted from the time of Aristotle to that of our author. L. l.
c. 39. In the MS. British Museum, Sloane 1754, ceruse is called
“Minium Album-’' This MS. is of the early hals of the four-
teenth century2.

The use of ceruse as a pigment is confined by Theophilus to
plaster work, wood, or canvass. Sir H. Davy in his analysis of the
colours of the ancients ³ found that the whites he examined “ were
all fine chalk‚’' yet, that Davy did not find white lead used upon a
mural decoration is no proof that it did not enter into the other
decorations, or pictureS, of the Romans, used in encaustic, or with
gums, gluten, or oil upon plaster work.

The white lead of the present period is a combination of prot-
oxide of lead with carbonic aeid, and is a sub-carbonate of lead.
It is prepared, at Clichy, by forming a precipitate‚ with carbonic
aeid gas, in a saturated solution of prot-oxide of lead in distilled
vinegar. The current of carbonic acid gas is passed through this
solution, and the precipitate is washed and dried.

A patent was recently taken in London sor a means of manu-
facturing white lead by one process from the metal. Very small
shot was violently agitated in water, by which a pulverulent
hydrated oxide was produced. This, having been exposed to the
air, became converted into a carbonate.

Had this powder been exposed to the action of carbonic aeid gas
in a close chamber, a fine carbonate of lead would have been pro-
duced fit for the artist; as it was, the patent was not much valued, as
two processcs would have been necessary during the manufacture.

kinds of cinnabar (κιννάβαρι) were known to the Greeks, the one
