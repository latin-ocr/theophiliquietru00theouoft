xxxii PREFACE.

Having shown, in a note to L. Ι. p. 63, of what the
varnish of Theophilus was composed‚ and which was
employed during the early period of art, there is every
reason to believe that ‘⁶ AMBER VARNISH” was one of
the inventions of the brothers Van Eyck3 and that this
invention was carried into the school of Venice we have
proof ¹. The head of a Venetian Doge, by John Bellini‚
in the National Gallery, is painted with this varnish.
Mr. Eastlake pointed out to me the amber beads
hanging upon the wall, in the picture by Van Eyck,
in the same place: this is a curious circumstance worth

notice.

’ In the manuscript, Sloane 345, Pl. 85 C„ which
contains a series of medical writings, ‘⁶ Tract. Var. Me-
dicinal.” collected by J ohannes Ketham, who flourished
towards the latter part of the fifteenth century, is a
book upon colours and materials for painting, written in
old Dutch or Flemish‚ and which should therefore be of
an earlier period in the same century. In this I found
the first mention of amber varnish yet upon record, and
it arrives from the country of Van Eyck. The MS. is
extremely difficult to read.

¹ I shall have better opportunity and more space to treat upon
this in a work, preparing, to which Ι have before alluded. MR.

will enter upon this subject.
