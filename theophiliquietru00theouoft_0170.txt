or something very like it, appears to have been used by some of

“ Aqua in qua semen lini diu, per diem et noctem saltim,
steterit, recipit ab ipso semine glutinositatem quae ipsam facit
aptam ad distemperandum colores.'’ Art. 347.

“ Water‚ in which linseed has remained for some time, for a day

Cennini, who mentions oil colours for painting upon walls, and
the use of which in his day was very extended, as he tells us that
the Germans used it much, “ che l’usano molto i tedeschi,”¹ gives

Theophilus uses this term in a sense approaching to that of
Catullus, who writes, “ Statua inaurata pallidior‚'’ more pallid than
a gilt statue.

Posc, c. 3. Posc, ἔ fuscus, or φαίος, dark or dusky. Scaliger
dict. quasi φωτοσκία, ἱ. e. lucis umbra, ὲ φωσκω,1ιιοεο. The mixture of
