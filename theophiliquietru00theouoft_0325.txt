you will do this until the gold adhere everywhere. Cut the
gold a second time, and superpose it with the copper instru-
ment, and do as above with the fire and brushes. And a
third time you do likewise. And when for the third time the
gold has commenced to dry, you will rub it with the dry
brushes until it begins to grow pale. If, however, it should
happen through negligence that any blemish appear upon the

OF POLISHING THE GILDING.

TAKE fine brass wire, bending it so that the folds may be the

be as one. Of these parcels make four, or five, or six, so that

of these small bundles, and pour in lead, so that when it has
become cold, and you have taken it out, these folds may adhere
together as if fixed in a leaden knob. In this manner make

them upon the coals, until, being made warm, they are
changed into a yellow colour, and lose the brightness which
