PREFACE

THE THIRD BOOK.

HE most renowned of the Prophet-s‚ David,—of

whom the Lord had prescience, and whom he pre-
destined before mundane ages, and whom, on account of
the simplicity and humility of -his mind, He elected, after
his own heart, and placed over the people- of his choice,
and established with his Holy Spirit, that he might nobly
and wisely regulate the conduct appertaining to so
great a name,—-concentrating within himself all the
power of his soul in the love of his Maker‚ uttered
these words amongst others :—“ Lord, I have Zoved the
beauty of thy house.” And although it was lawful that
a man of so much authority and of such capacious in-
tellect should call house that habitation of heavenly
worship in which God presides in ineffable brightness
over the hymus of choirs of angels, towards which 116
himself yearned with all his souL saying, ‘⁶ One thinq
have I desired qf the Loqui, that will I seelc estem· that
I may dwell in the house (ff the Lord all the days qf my
fise? or, as the refuge of a devoted breast and most
pure beart, in which God truly dwelt, of which asylum
an intense desire again prays forth, ‘⁶ Renew a mylae
spirit within me, O Lord'’—yet it is certain that he
strongly desired the embellishment of the material
house of God, which is the place of prayer.
