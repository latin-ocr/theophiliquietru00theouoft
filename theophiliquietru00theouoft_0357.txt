and the breadth of a thumb, which handle will have a lion's
head at the extremity, cast and properly sculptured, which
head will hold the small basin in his mouth. It will also
have at the other end a head carved in a similar manner, in
the mouth of which a ring will hang, by means of which it
can be carried, the finger being inserted. The remainder of
the handle between the two heads should be decorated in
places with niello, and in places be ornamented with molten
and point work and letters of verses in their places. The
small cup, which is at the extremity‚ should be perforated at
bottom in the centre, of the size of two fingers in circumfer—
ence, with very fine holes, through which the wine and the
water to be placed in the chalice should run, by means of
which the sacrament of the Lord's blood is accomplished.

'CHAPTER LVIII.

OF THE VIAL.

ΒΗΤ if you wish to make the vial for pouring out the wine,
beat the silver in the same manner as the knot of the foot of
the chalice is beaten, excepting that the body of the vial
should be formed much wider, and its neck be narrowed upon
a long and slender anvil with the moderate-sized horned and
iron hammer. Sometimes also the vial, when its formation
has commenced, may be filled with wax, and be lightly struck
with the middling iron hammer, that the roundness of the
body and the shape of the neck may be more properly and
evenly trimmed. And thus, the wax being taken out, it may
again be re-heated upon the coals, and the wax again be put
in, and it may be beaten as before until it is altogether formed.
Which being done, if you wish to make upon the vial figures,
or animals, or flowers in beaten work, first compose the mix-
ture of pitch and wax and tile.
