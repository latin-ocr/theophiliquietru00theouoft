employ it, without seeing it turn black, by adding white or a

Joasaph, one of the best painters of Mount Athos. The pro-
cesses of this day are the same, nearly, as those of former times.

‘⁶ Here, then, is the manner in which I saw a fresco painted in the
Monastery of Esphigmenou‚ by Father Joasaph, by his brother,
by his first pupil, who was a ‘ diacre’ and the future heir of the
