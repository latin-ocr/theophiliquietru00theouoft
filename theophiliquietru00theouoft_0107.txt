CHAPTER XXX.

OF GRINDING GOLD FOR BOOKS AND OF CASTING THE MILL.

WHEN you have traced out figures or letters in books, take
pure gold and file it very finely in a clean cup or small basin,
and wash it with a pencil in the shell of a tortoise, or a shell
which is taken out of the water. Have then a mill with its
pestle, both cast from metal of copper and tin mixed toge-
ther, so that three parts may be of pure copper‚ and the fourth
of pure tin, free from lead. With this composition the mill is
cast in the form of a small mortar, and its pestle round about
an iron in the form of a knot, so that the iron may protrude
of the thickness of a finger, and in length a little more than
half a foot, the third part of which ironis fixed in wood care-
fully turned, in length about one yard, and pierced very
straightly3 in the lower part of which, however, of the length
of four fingers from the end, must be a revolving wheel,
either of wood or of lead, and in the middle of the upper
part is fixed a leather strap, by which it can be pulled, and, in
revolving, be drawn back. Then this mill is placed in a
hollow, upon a bench fitted for it, between two small wooden
pillars firmly fixed into the same bench, upon which another
piece of wood is to be inserted, which can be taken out and
replaced, in the middle of which, at the lower part, is a hole iu
which the pestle of the mill will revolve. These things thus
disposed, the gold, earefully cleansed, is put into the mill, a
little water added, and the pestle placed, and the upper piece
of wood fitted, the strap is drawn and is permitted to revolve,
again pulled and again it revolves, and this must so be done

¹ - for two or three hours. Then the upper wood is taken off,

and the pestle washed in the same water with a pencil. After-
wards the mill is taken up, and the gold, with the water, is
stirred to the bottom with the pencfl, and is left a little, until
thel grosser part subsides 3 the water is presently poured into
a very clean> basin, and whatever gold comes away with the
water is ground. Replacing the water and the pestle, and
