Nmnnm, c. 12. The black pigments used by the ancients were,
according to the Greek and Roman writers, either black earths or
carbonised vegetable substances‚ as in the present dayl.

In the “ Tab. Voc. Syn.” we find “ Black is an earth which
is called black stone, it is sufficiently soft for drawing. Black is
likewise a colour from charcoal, ground, or it is made from the
smoke of a lamp or candle. It is elsewhere called fuscus and
elsewhere sanctonicus.”

“Actramentum is also used in painting, when it is made from
the smoke of a burning candle or lamp, or from the charcoal of a
soft wood, or of the vine.’' Idem.

Eraclius² speaks of the black from resin burnt, also of ‘⁶ the
charcoal of soft wood and of the stones of peaches, which are pro—

vine burnt.’' He adds, “ but vine twigs become of a blacker co-
lour if steepedin the best wine and afterwards burnt, gluten being
added.’'

In the Sloane MS. 1754, of the fourteenth century, the black
directed to be used is vine black, “ nigrum optimum ex carboni-

vine black as well as the black chalk‚ and of peach-stone black and
of black made by burning linseed oil in a recipient.

Baths of Livia and the Aldobrandine Marriage all deflagrated with
nitre, having all the properties of carbonaceous blacks.
