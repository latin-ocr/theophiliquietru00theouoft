xxvi PREFACE.

bookS, so much insisted on as proof of his Germanic
origin, would be employed as explanatory, not used
idiomatically. Both Greek and Italian terms are like-
wise employed, as “asperella‚” “smignla,’' “ismaris‚”
‘⁵ isca,” &c., &c.

The most important, because the most voluminous
and correct, if not the most ancient, manuscript, now
remains to be noticed, and which Ι was fortunate
enough to discover among the Harleian Manuscripts at
the British Museum. Owing to the imperfect classifi-
cation of these MSS. towards the end of the last cen-
tury, this had remained unknown or unnoticed until I
had withdrawn it from its hiding-place3 classed in the
general catalogue immediately under the head of THE-
OLOGY, and after “ Theophilus ’⁷ the ecclesiastic, is found
“ Theophilus, monachus;” it has doubtless‚ therefore,
been classed with works on theology. It is not men-
tioned under the works treating upon the arts, but
under the head “Natural Philosophy,'' “Physics‚'’ is
found ‘⁶ Theophilus Monachus, de Chemia,” a position
in which we should never have expected to find our
author upon ‘⁶ The Divers Arts,” and which sufficiently
accounts for its neglect¹.

· This manuscript is upon vellum, in octavo, and is
written in a clear German character of the very com-
mencement of the thirteenth century. Sir F. Madden,
the keeper of the manuscripts at the British Museum,

¹ Sir Frederick Madden assures me that, although he was aware
of the existence of such a manuscript, he was unacquainted with
its true importance and value, until it had been called for by me in
Janumy, 1844, and he had collated it with the Paris edition,
printed in 1843, by the Count Charles de l’Escalopier.
