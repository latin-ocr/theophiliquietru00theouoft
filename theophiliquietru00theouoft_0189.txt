CHAPTER I.

OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FURNACE FoR MAKING GLASS.

Snonm) you intend to make glaSS, first cut a quantity of
beech-wood logs and dry them. Then burn them together in
a clean spot, and, carefully collecting the ashes, take care
that you mix no earth with them. Afterwards build a furnace
of stones and clay, in length fifteen feet and breadth ten, in

making a hearth in the midst, firm and even, of stone and

separation to surmount a little. After which make, in the
lar-ger space, four openings on one side, lengthwise‚ and four
on the other, through the midst of the hearth, in which the
work vessels are placed3 also two openings in the middle,
through which the flames may rise3 and building a wall round
about, make two windows, four palms in length and one in
breadth, one on each side, opposite the openings, through
which the vases, with those things put into them, are intro-

space through the middle of the hearth near the centre wall
