CHAPTER LX.
OF THE BEATEN CENSER.

IF however you should wish to make a censer in beaten work,
in gold, silver, or brass, you will first purify it in 'the above
order, and you pour into the iron moulds‚ two, or three, or
four marks, according to the quantity which you wish the
upper portion of the censer to possess. You will then thin it
in a circle in the same way as the larger silver chalice above
mentioned, exceptiug, that this work is thicker and is to be
depressed deeper inside, that it may be higher outside, so that
its height may possess the whole of its breadth and one half
of it. When you have lengthened out its height, before you
limit the breadth, portray towers in it, namely, on the top,
one octangular‚ in which the same number of windows are
made ς under which four square towers are made, upon every
one of which three columns are placed, and between them
two lengthened windows, in the midst of which, over the
middle column, a small round window is made: under these,
in the third place, eight other towers are made ; namely, four
round, against the upper squares, in which are made small
flowers, or birds, or animals‚ or small windows, and between
these four square (towers) which may be yet broader, in
which the half figures of angels are made, as if resting in
them with their wings. Under which, in the rounding itself
of the vase, four arches are made, a little drawn out at the
top, in which are made the evangelists, whether in likeness
of angels, or in figures of animals3 between these arches,
upon the edge of the rounding, four heads of lions are placed,
or of men, cast, through which the chains may pass. Ι These
things thus portrayed, they are struck out with the ductile
and hammering irons, inside and outside‚ until they are
altogether shaped, and are thus filed and rasped and chased
with the sculping instruments. This is the upper part of the
censer. Then the lower part with its foot is struck out, in
which four arches are made which may correspond to those
above, in which may rest the four rivers of Paradise, in human
