short and bent, must be fixed on, or a piece of wood, with
which it can be revolved. You will then have two small
wooden columns fixed upon a bench and separated from each
other according to the length of the iron, each of which may
have in the front part single wedges, also wooden, in measure
apalm in length, and cut like a ladder ; upon which another
round wood may be placed, so that it can be moved nearer or
farther: upon this the hand of the turner can rest. These
things thus arranged place, between these two columns the
turning iron which holds the “ nucleus,'' and the assistant
who may turn it sitting before you upon the left hand, you
will turn it with sharp and wide insu-ments everywhere until
it is smooth, and you will so form these “nuclei'' that they may
be joined together by an equal breadth and thickness in the
middle. You will cut in the lower part from the middle
downwards, so that the upper breadth may by two measures
exceed the lower, in which you will also form the foot. In
the same proportion also you cut the upper part, the height
of which, however, will be such that it is cut in (three times),
to the shape of a bell-founder's wooden (block), so that every
cutting may be slighter upwards. These being thus turned,
take out the iron, and with a knife cut, in the broader border
of the upper nucleus, four angles as far as the nearest cutting,
so that it may be formed in the manner of a cross, and let
each projection have equal breadth in the sides, but contain
in height a measure and a half of the breadth, in which you
will form also small pinnacles in likeness of roofs. You also
make in the next tower eight ribs, four wide and four narrow,
which you also make round, so that the angles of the wider

’ may project‚ and of the narrower be hollow, so that a round-

ness may appear3 in these you will form proper roofs to the
size. You will fashion the penultimate tower in the same
manner, so, however, that round ribs are formed over the
broad parts of the lower, and that the round parts of the
lower are adjusted under the broad parts of the upper. But
the upper tower must be formed with eight ribs, equally broad
and without roofs. This will be the upper part of the censer.
