they have been cut out with the small hammer, or cutting
iron, or with a knife, anoint them with the grease of an old
hog, and bind them round with small straps cut from the skin
of the buck-goat, and tie them with flaxen thread. After-
wards cover them one by one with beaten clay, and leave the
handles bare. And when they are dry place them in the fire,
and blow strongly, and the skin is burned ; and quickly taking
them from the clay, extinguish them equally in water, and,
being taken out, you will dry them at the fire.

 

CHAPTER XX.

OF TEMPERING IRON.

Gnoovmo irons are likewise tempered in this manner. When
they have been filed and fitted in their handles, their end is
placed in the fire‚ and presently, when it has begun to glow,
it is taken out and quenched in water.

CHAPTER XXI.

OF THE SAME.

Anommz kind of tempering of iron instrumente is also made
in this manner, by which glass is cut, and also the soster
stones. Take a three year old buck-goat, and tie him up
within doors for three days without food3 on the fourth day
give him fern to eat and nothing else. When he shall have
caten this for two days, on the night following enclose himin
a cask perforated at the bottom, under which holes place an-
other sound vessel in which you can collect his urine. Having
in this manner for two or three nights sufficiently collected this,
turn out the buck, and temper yourinstruments in this urine.
Iron instrumente are also tempered in the urine of a young
red-haired boy harder than in simple water.
