TRANSLATION. 409

OF THE SIGNS IN SEEKING wA'rER.

THE signs in tracing water are found to be of this kind.
The slender rush, the creeping willovv, the hemp tree, the

alder‚ reed, ivy, and other (plants) which cannot be produced
without moisture. Forasmuch as similar things are produced
in marshes, it is easy to have confidence in these. You will
likewise try these devices for water3 the place, therefore,
where these signs are found, must be dug, not less in width
than three feet, in depth five3 and about sunset‚ a clean leaden
or brazen vessel punctured inside is properly placed, with oil in
a hole, and green leaves, or reeds, being placed over the
hollow, the earth is brought over it. On another day it is
opened; should moisture, or rills, be found, this place will,
without doubt, have water. If likewise a dry vase of chalk,
not burnt‚ should be placed and enclosed in the same fashion‚
if this place will have water, the vase will be found dissolved
by humidity. Should fleece of wool, placed likewise in this
spot, collect so much moisture that upon another day it can
be expressed‚ it shews that the place will have a great plenty
of water. If a lantern full of oil burnt in the same place,
similarly covered, should be found shining upon another day,
it will indicate that this place possesses water, because all
heat attracts moisture to itself. Likewise, should you make a
(fire ¹) in the same place, and should the heated earth raise up
a moist and nebulous smoke, it also shews that the place pos-
sesses water. When these things have thus been found by
certain signs, the wells will be dug out in depth, until a source
of water be found, or, should there be many, they may be
collected in one. The signs of water are mostly to be found,
however, under the feet of mountains on the northern situa-
tion. For in these places they are found sweet, salubrious
and abundant3 when, through the beneficence of nature, they
are withdrawn from the course of the sun and veiled by the
shadows of trees, or mountains, they fiow forth with cool
welcome in summer, with warm pleasantness in winter.

¹ There is here a void in the manuscript which we have filled up.
