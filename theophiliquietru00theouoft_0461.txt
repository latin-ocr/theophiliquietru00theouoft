same stones are rubbed upon it and polished. The amethyst,
which is harder‚ is polished in this manner. There is a stone
called emery, which is broken until like sand, and is placed,
mixed with water, upon a smooth copper tablet, and by
rubbing upon it the amethyst is fashioned. The washing
which flows from it is carefully received in a clean basin, and
when it has stood for a night, on the day following the water
is entirely withdrawn and the powder is dried‚ this is after-
wards placed, moistened with saliva, upon a smooth lime-

’ wood tablet‚ and the amethyst is polished upon it. Glass

stones‚ also, are urubbed and polished in the same manner
as crystal.

CHAPTER XCV.

OF PEARLS.

PEARLS are found in sea-shells and (shells) of other waters;
these are perforated with a fine steeled instrument which is
fi'xed in wood, having a small wheel of lead, also another
wood in which it may be turned, to which a strap must be
placed by which it may be revolved. But should it be neces-
sary that the aperture of any pearl be made larger, a wire
may be placed in the opening with a little fine sand, one end
of which may be held in the teeth‚ the other in the left hand,
and by the right the pearl is conducted upwards and down-
wards‚ and in the mean time sand is applied, that the aperture
may become wider. Sea shells are also cut into pieces and
are filed as pearls‚ sufficiently useful upon gold, and they are
polished as above.
