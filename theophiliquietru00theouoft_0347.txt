can hold the outer pieces of gold in three places outside, so
that the third which compasses the inside near the edge, cannot
be disunited. This being done, anoint the solder everywhere,
and you will dry it a little over the fire, and the coals being
arranged and glowing you make a hollow among them, in
which you place the handle, and about this you will arrange
the coals in order, so that they may not touch the gold, but rise
around it like a wall, until they dominate the gold 3 and you
will then place above it two or three slight pieces of iron,
which may pass across. Over this you will place the coals
everywhere, and cover it carefully, so however that some
openings may remain among these coals, through which you
can 500 how the solder flows. When you 500 which instantly
sprinkle it with a little water: you take it out and will gently
wash and dry it, and, carefully considering it, if there 15 any
fault you correct it, and again anointing it as before, you will
solder it, and do this until it is made firm everywhere. In this
manner you will make the other handle and solder it. Which
being accomplished‚ join them both to the cup of the chalice
in their places, and make two lines upon the cup itself with a
graver, by means of which you can 500 whether they are
placed straight in soldering. Then melt pure gold, and mix
with it a third part of red and pure copper‚·which likewise,
fused and slightly beaten, you will file altogether and place in
a goose quill. After this accumulate before the furnace a
great heap of 00315, and place in them the cup of the chalice,
50 that half of it may be altogether under the coals, and that
part upon which a part of the handle is to be placed may
altogether rise above them; you immediately join which
(handle) on to it, and anoint the vase with the handle inside
and out with the soldering, and you will scatter the filings
which you had placed in the quill inside and out with the
solder‚ about the junction by which the handle 15 united to
the cup, and thus, fire being placed around, you will heap the
coals in a circle, as you did before about the handle, and
place the irons over it, which you cover plentifully with coals.
In the front part within the hollow of the cup place the coals
in the shape of a small furnace, 50 that the 00315 may lie
