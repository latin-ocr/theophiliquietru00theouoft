CHAPTER XXII.

OF CRUCIBLES FOR MELTING GOLD AND SILVER.

HAleG all these things ready to your hands, take white clay
and grind it very fine, and old vases, in which gold or silvei· has
been before melted ; being taken, break them up separately.
If you have not these, take baked fragments of white earthen
pots, and put them in the fire until they glow, and if they do
not crack allow them to cool and grind them apart. Then
put two parts of the ground clay and a fourth¹ part of the
burnt pot fragments, and mix it with warm water, beat it
strongly, and make crucibles large and small of it, in which
you can melt gold and silver. And in the mean time, while
they are drying, taking the balance, weigh the gold or silver
which you wish to be worked. But if the silver be not pure,
purify it in this manner.

CHAPTER XXIII.

OF PURIFYING SILVER.

SIFT ashes, mixing them with water, and take an earthen
vessel proved in the fire, which must be of such a size as you
think, the silver‚ which is to be purified, can be melted in,
so that it may not be scattered, and put the ashes into it,
slightly in the middle, but thick round the border, and dry it
upon the coals. Being dry, remove the coals a little from
the furnace, and place it with the ashes under the opening
before the furnace, so that the wind from the bellows may
flow into it, and the 00315 being placed over it, blow until
it glows. Then place the silver in it, and superpose a little
lead, and, the coals being heaped over it, melt it, and have
near you 3 rod cut from the hedge and dried in the wind, with
