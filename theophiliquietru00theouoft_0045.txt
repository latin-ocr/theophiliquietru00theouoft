PREFACE. xxvii

and whose authority is conclusive, states that it is of
that period, and that it is certainly written in Germany ¹.
It contains 115 folios of the books of Theophilus, and
five folios of recipes relating to the arts, written by
another hand of the period. A treatise ‘⁶ De Unguen- ’
tis '' follows; it is a collection of medical recipes. The
title and preface to the first book are unfortunately
wanting; in so voluminous and superior a copy some-
thing might have been otherwise adduced from these
which would have unravelled the mystery which shrouds
the age and country of our author.

That this MS. is likewise but a copy from an older
work is proved by the variations it presents from the
Vienna and Wolfenbiittel MSS„ supplying many omis-
sions, claiming also the restoration of a few which I
have carefully noted during the progress of the work.
The four chapters missing in the second book (see
Index, p. 110), have probably been cut from the ori-
ginal, as no lacuna is left by the scribe in this.

It will be observed upon perusal that the whole of
the work, from C. LXXXI. L. III. p. 345, is new.
It had been hitherto lost; the promises held out in the
preface to the First Book are fulfilled.

The Third Book has evidently been treated by
Theophilus with more care and attachment than-the
others. The eloquent preface, the labour expended in
description, and the great volume of the work upon
metals, attest this. He had proceeded gradually to
describe “all those things which were still wanting
among the utensils of the House of the Lord,''² when

¹ Sir Frederick stated to me that it was not impossible that this
MS. was written at the end os the twelfth century.
