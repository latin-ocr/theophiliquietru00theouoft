diately removed, but kept for a space, that, should the brass
sink, it may again be poured over. But should you wish
to withdraw from this fatigue of carrying and founding in
parts, procure for yourself a very large pot, which must be
flat at the 'bottom‚ and make an opening in it on the side at
the bottom‚ and cover it with clay inside and without, as
above. This being done, station it near the mould, not
farther than a distance of five feet, and fasten it round with
stakes‚ and lay in fire with coals. And when it has become
glowing close the opening, which will be towards the mould,
with clay, and arrange upon it four pieces ‘of wood, and make
the small stakes inside the furnace, as above. Then‚ the
copper being placed in with coals and fire, and three ranges
of bellows being applied, cause them to be manfully blown.
In the mean time you have a dry piece of wood of such length
that it can reach from the opening in the pot to the mouth of
the mould, the bend of this must be ample. When you shall
have covered this everywhere with clay and especially above,
inter it that it may be even With the ground, but rather higher
near the pot, and heap ignited coals upon it. The tin being
placed in and stirred with the copper, as above with the
curved iron which is strongly fixed upon wood, open the hole‚
and with the assistants, who can hold two straining cloths, al-
low them to flow out, sometimes withholding, however, as
above. And when the mould has become full should any
brass remain in the pot, place a mass of clay upon the end of
a stout stick and press strongly in front of the opening that
you may close it. In both these manners also smaller bells
can be founded, according to the quantity the pots can make.
When the brass shall have become hard in the funnel, cause
the earth to be hastily cast out of the hollow and the ground
outside to become somewhat cold. The earth being thrown Δ
out, this mould must be inclined on one side and be laid upon
the ground, and this is done until, in the same manner as it
was placed in, it is taken out of the hollow. This being ac-
complished, it is laid down entirely upon one side, and with
hatchets and other sharp instruments which are fixed upon
long pieces of wood, the inside clay is hastily cast out, be-
