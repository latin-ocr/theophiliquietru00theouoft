fnay be able to lie half in it, and you will fasten it with wax
in this same piece of wood that it may adhere; and taking 6
3111611 hammer strike lightly in the middle of the knob in one
place until you make a small hole, and so by striking in the
centre and by carefully breaking around it you will increase
the hollow. And when by thus persevering you have arrived
at the very middle of the knob, turn it round and clo similarly
upon the other side. When you have transpierced this, beat
a piece of copper the length of a foot, and round, so that it
6611 pass through the opening, and taking sharp sand mlxed
with water, place it in the opening and file with the copper.
When you have somewhat dilated the opening, beat another
thicker copperdwith which you will file in a similar manner,
and should ne d be you add a third thicker copper. And
when you ha e enlarged the opening as you may wish, break
a ne very finely, and this being placed in, you will
file it with a new copper until it become even. Then take a
piece of lead, rounded in the same manner, and the powder
of tile, with saliva being added, you polish the opening inside‚
and the knob itself outside, as above. Purest crystal of a
very round form, and polished and moistened with water or
saliva, and exposed in the light of the sun, tinder which they
call “ tentura'' being placed under it, so that the light may
shine upon it, attracts fire with the greatest velocity. But
should you wish to cut crystal, fix four wooden pegs upon a
bench, between which the crystal can lie firmly, which pegs
will so stand, that two must be joined together above and
two below, so closely that the saw can scarcely be drawn be-
tween them, and that it can in no part be turned, and placing
011 1116 iron saw, and casting over it sharp sand mixed with
water, make two (assistants) stand who can draw it, and who
must cast the sand with water upon it without intermission.
This must be done until the crystal be divided into two pieces,
which you will rub and polish over as above. In the same-
manner the onyx and beryl‚ malachite, jasper and agate and
other precious stones are cut, rubbed and polished3 a very
fine powder is also made of fragments of crystal which, mixed
with water, is placed upon a flat piece of lime-wood, and these
