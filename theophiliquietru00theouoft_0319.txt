silver with the gold into it, and with quickness rub and grind
it with the curved and glowing iron, until you feel in the vase
nothing but a liquid, and directly pour it into water. This
water being thrown away, put the gold into the left hand,
and wash it carefully, proving with the finger if it be well
ground, and if it is, place it upon a clean linen eloth, and cast
it here and there until the water be dried away.

 

CHAPTER XXXVI.
THE SAME, IN ANo'rHER MANNER.

Burs if the nature of the gold is such that you cannot thus
giind it, take a smooth stone, and make a hollow three
fingers in breadth, and of a like depth. Then fashion for
yourself a harder stone than it, small, so that it can be
turned round in this hollow, and long, so that it can be fixed
and made firm in wood, which wood must be three yards in
length, and in the lower part, to which the stone is to be
joined, it must be of the thickness of a flute. Above this
stone, at the height of half a foot, this wood is pierced through,
and to which another thin piece of wood, two palms in
breadth‚ in which a projection is made, which may pass
through the perforation of the long piece of wood, upon which
thin wood a stone is tied, of the size of a foot, from which
stoue upwards the wood is made thiu and cut round and
smooth‚ so that it can be turned round between the hands.
These things being thus arranged, place the larger stone in a
basin, or a flat wooden vase, and see that the stone lie firmly
and that the vase is firmly placed. And when you have
placed the gold with the quicksilver in the hollow, and sand
and water above it, put on the smaller stone which is joined
to the wood, and holding this wood in the upper part, turn it
round a little between your hands, and soon, through the im-
pulse of that stone which is fixed on below, it is carried
round ‚ and thus, by the rotation‚ grind for four or three hours.
Sometimes, however, examine it and prove it with the finger,
