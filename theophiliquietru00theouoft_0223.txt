quite curved back, so that an opening may appear in the
middle. Then take the painted and burnt glass, and place it
in its order upon the other part of the table, where there is no
drawing. After that take the head of any one figure, and
surrounding it with lead, relay it carefully in its place, and
fasten round it three nails with a hammer proper for this
work, joining to it the chest and arms and the remaining
’ draperies3 and whatever part you would solder fasten outside
with nails, that it may not be moved from its place. Then
have a soldering iron which is long and slender, but at the
end thick and round, and at the end of this round part di-

have cast, and anoint them over on both sides with wax, and

soldered. Taking the hot iron, apply the tin to it in what-

the iron until they adhere to each other. The figures being
set up, you will arrange the grounds in the same manner, and
of whatever colour you wish, and so, piece-meal, you compose
your window. The window being finished and soldered on
one side, turned upon the other you will make it firm every
where in the same manner, by rasping and soldering.

picture are made with gold or orpiment, thesein windows are
made with clear yellow glass. W hen you have painted which
