green, mixed in the same manner, without succus, and be-
tweenv them let a white trait be made. Then mix, from cin-
nabar and white, what tints you wish, so that the first may
possess little cinnabar, the second more, the third more
still, the fourth yet more, until you arrive at pure cinnabar.
Then mix a little red with the last ; then use pure red. After
this mix red with black; at the last use black. In a similar
manner mingle together colours from green and white, until
you arrive at pure green. Then add to it a little succus, mix
again, and add more succus, after this admix a little black, ’
then more, at last pure black. But you make shadows on
ochre with red ; black being added at the last. Shadow ma-
nisc with folium, black being added at the last. Shadow fo-
lium with red, black being added at the last. These colours are
so applied, that the paler tints may issue from the centre and
so increase until they arrive at the black, outside. More than
twelve of these traits may never exist in each colour3 and, if
you wish as many, so temper the mixtures, that you place the
pure colour in the seventh row. If you wish nine, place the pure
colour in the sixth row. If you wish eight or seven, place the
pure colour in the fifth. If you wish six, in the fourth. If five,
in the third. If four or three, do not interpose any pure co-
lour, but leave that one for a pure colour which should have
been placed before the pure colour, and mingle its shadow co-
lour towards the outer black. In this manner circular and
quadrangular thrones are made, and drawings round borders‚
and branches of trees with their boughs, and columns and
round towers and seats, and whatever you wish should ap-
pear round. Arches are also made upon columns in houses
by the same means, but in one colour, so that the inner part
is white and the outer black. Round towers are made of ochre,
and so that the white stroke may be in the middle, and on
either side may spread quite a pale ochre and a little inclining
to saffron colour until the last plan but one; with which a little
red is mixed; then more, so however, that neither pure ochre
nor pure red may appear. In the same way and with the
same mixture round towers are made with black and white
Branches of trees are mixed from green and ochre, a little
