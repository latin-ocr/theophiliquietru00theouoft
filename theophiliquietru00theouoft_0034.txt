Italy, the jeweller¹3 France, the worker in glass3 Spain,
the chemist3 industrious Germany, anxious in acquir-ing
dexterity, or knowledge in all: when all these artists
had constructed and were adorning the church of St.
Mark at Venice, and were elsewhere occupied in
Western Europe in “writing” or painting the sacred
histories in the churches (the terms were at that time
synonymous), so that the illiterate might read the ex-
amples set before them ², the “ TREATISE UPON D1VERs
ARTs ’' came forth.

It is, however, principally by analysis of the processes
described by our author that we can be enabled to as-
certain with some precision the epoch at which he
wrote. Lessing, Leist, Raspe and Emeric David, have
placed Theophilus in the tenth century, a period too
early, as we may confidently infer, by remarking the
occurrence in the work, not only of Arab mysticism,
but of Arab nomenclature. The chapter of Theophilus
on the production of ‘⁶ Spanish Gold,’' L. ΙΙΙ. p. 267, is
evidence of the former; his mention of Borax, p. 239,
under the confused name of Barabas or Parahas, of the
latter; while both instances sheW‚ at the same time, a

¹ This was at a period before Italy had for a second time become
glorious by means of art. This word “ glorious‚’' applied to Italy,
is not found in any of the older MSS. of Theophilus, and is cer-
tain'ly an interpolation of Le Begue himself, in whose MS. only it
is found, and who wrote at the commencement of the fifteenth cen-
tury, when Italy had indeed acquired a claim to the title.

² The council of ‘Arras in ΑΛ). 1025, declared that “ the books
of the illiterate were the paintings in the temples.’' Illiterati, quod
per scripturam non possunt intueri, hoc per quaedam picturae linea-
menta contemplantur.’'—Synod. Attrab. C, 3. Τ. 1’. p. 62. Apud
D’Achery.
