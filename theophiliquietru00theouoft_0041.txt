PREFACE. xxiii

No. 2527), belongs to the twelfth, or, at latest, to the
very commencement of the thirteenth century ς the
other (No. 11236) is but a copy, but made from an-
other manuscript than our own3 it is of the seventeenth
century, and is upon paper.”

“The ancient manuscript is defective: it commences
by the three prologues of the three books, the index of
chapters of the first book follows. The rubric of the
first chapter stands, De temperamento colorum in nudis
corporibus the last, the thirty-eighth‚ Quomodo colores
in libris temperentur. The second book contains thirty-
five chapters, of which the title of the first is, De eon-
structione furni ad operandum vitrum; the last, De anu-
lis. The third book contains seventy-eight chapters3
the first, De constructione fabricae, the last, De ommim
but, as I have said, some leaves are wanting at the end.”

“The other MS„ the modern copy, gives also the
prologue of each book, and then the index3 the first
book contains forty-two chapters, viz„ De temperamento
colorum, &Q the last, De cerosa. The second book is
composed of thirty-five chapters, conformable in every
thing to the other MS.; and the third book contains
seventy-six chapters, viz„ De constructione fabrieoe3
the last, De oryanis, and finishes ‘ a plectro autem inse-
rius omnes unius mensum] et ejusdem ‚orossitudinis erunt.
F inis? ’'

It will be seen that the more modern manuscript is
similar to that at WolfenbiitteL which is deficient in
the C. xl. L. 1. De encausto, contained by the Harleian
and the Cambridge University MSS.

Dr. Wolf thus replies to my demand respecting the
four missing chapters in the second book, which yet
form a part of the index.
