66 NOTES To BOOK 1.

nicia and the islands of the Mediterranean and the Archipelago ς
probably also thence its name of “Haur Romana,” for Andrea
Alpagus, in his “Liber Arabicorum Nominum,'’ tells us that,
“Harrire, id est Juniperus,” and Rulandus, ‘⁶ Lex. Alchim.’'
that “ Hara, i. e. Juniperus.” ¹

The following will show that the comparative term, “ glassa,‘’
has been applied to sandarac, as glessum or glass to amber, pro-
bably for the same reason, “ a similitudine vitri.” “ Glassa est
genus vernicis.” Rulandus, Lex. Alchem. “Glassa est genus
vernicis.” Johnson, Lex. Med. “. Glassa est genus vernicis
siccioris.” castelli, Lex. Chym. “ Vernice est vernix gattos-03⁹
Johnson, Lex. M. “ Sandarax, id est vernix gummi.” Serapio,

c. 57.

But the word “ fornis,” the firniss, vulgo furniss, of the Ger-
mans, is a direct name for the same resin, from the Latin vernix.

Patr. Dic. Med. gives the derivation of the Arab word sandarac,
saghad-narak, gummy ;> and this author calls the cedrus gummi
“ vernix ” ‘ quia verno tempore fluat‚’ because it fiows in the spring
season.

Ruland has shown that the word ‘⁴ fernis ” has been Latinized as

well as “ glas,” “ porro quia resina illa juniperi sandarax, et ver-
nix dicitur apud Arabes, unus error alterum traxit. Quidam in-
docti mox factitiunt hoc, quod vocamus vernis (oder vernixclz) quo
utuntur pictores, et alii artifices, quod fit ex oleo et gummi, ha—
buere pro vera sandaracha metallica, ut si scriberes, R sandaracae,’'
illi intellexerunt, secundum ‘ Arabes,’ R gummi vel resinam juni-
peri, aut ‘sernia-em ’ illum factitium,” διο.
’ The Paris MS. contains the addition of the word “ Arabicum ’'
‘⁴ glassa vocatur, aliter Arabicum.” This manuscript is of the
fifteenth century, and *this interpolation is a proof that the ‘⁶ Arabic
sandarac ” was understood as the “ fomis '’ by the copyist.

Pliny² “ De picis generibus et resinis⁹⁹ mentions “ Arabica
resina,” and in so doing gives a good description of sandarac.
“ Arabica resina alba est, acri odore, difficile coquenti.’' The
acidulous pungent smell yielded by this resin when melted is pe-
culiar to it, and it is one of the most difficolt of the resins to unite

¹ The black poplar was also called “ Haur Romana,⁷’ and Martial calls the “ gum ”

of the “black poplar ” “ succina gemma.” Ep. lib. 4, 32, another confusion.
