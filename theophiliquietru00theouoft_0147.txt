conjunction of the reeds at the top of the habitation (or temple).
Or “ Laquearia’' are what are laid over the beams and are inter-
woven with those beams. Also laquearia are those works which
cover and ornament apartments3 hence Josephus in V1110, “De
lignis celatis, opere laqueario, auroque vestitis.”

Thus, from originally denoting the interwoven wood, reed, or
plaster work, the word became applied to the ornaments with which
that work was covered, and in such sense it is used by Theophilus.

St. Isidore, L. xix. c. 12, Originum 3 thus refers to laquearia.

‘⁶ Laquearia sunt quae cameram subtegunt et ornunt, quae et
lacunaria dicuntur: quod lacus quosdam quadratos vel rotundos
ligno vel gipso vel coloribus habeat pictos, cum signis intermican-
tibus.”

JEREMIAH, c. 22, v. 14. “ Et facit laquearia cedrina, pingitque
synopide‚” “ and it is ceiled with cedar and painted with sinoper,”
(translated vermilion in the English version.)

Pliny tells us that Pamphilus, the master of ApelleS, instituted
the custom of painting “ lacunaria” or the intervals between
beams or arches upon walls, and adds “ nec cameras ante eum
taliter adornari mos suit.’'

LAzun, c. 14. The Lazur of Theophilus is doubtless the male
cyanus of the Greeks, the deep blue lapis armenus, the Kuanos,
κυανός, of Theophrastus, which has, as yet, been confounded with
the lapis lazuli, or Greek σάπφειρος.

Theophrastus mentions among the valuable stones “oedaevsngov,''
“ Sapphire,” which is of a dark dye¹, and not very different from
the male cyahus “ κυανδς.” This comparison, Hill remarks, “is a
confirmation that the sapphire and cyanus are not the same stone,
as they are compared together3 ’' it may be added that it identifies
the sapphire with the lapis lazuli‚ the cyanus being of two
kinds, divided int-o male and female, the male being of a deeper
colour2. Yet Hill here unfortunately falls into error, as he re-
marks that “ this cyanus is a gem, and is the lapis lazuli of
which ultramarine is made,” whereas that colour is only truly
made from the sapphire of the Greeks, the true “lapis lazuli.'’
Theophrastus does not speak of cyanus “ as a gem” at all;
noticing that in the “carnelian” and the “lapis lyncurius’'
