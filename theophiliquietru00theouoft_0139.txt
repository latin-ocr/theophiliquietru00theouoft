NOTES To BOOK 1. 69

pictore excellentissimo inter omnes pictores mundi‚'’ gave this
composition to be used in the preparation of “ ultramarine,'’ and
speaks 'first of ‘⁴ vernice liquida,” with which resin and gum mastic
are to be united. This was in 1410.

John Le Begue himself gives the preparation of a ‘⁶ vernix
liquide pour paintres.’' The process is the same as that in the
second recipe of Theophilus. But Le Begue directs, ‘⁴ Take
aromatic glassa which is dull outside, and when broken it is clear
and shining inside, like glass.” “ Prenez glasse aromatique qui est
obscur par dehors, et par dedans, quand on le brise‚ il est clere et
luisant a maniere de verre.” With this, oil of linseed or hempseed,
or walnuts is to be used, two parts to one of resin. He concludes,
‘⁴ Et l’etendez desus la peinture a vos doigts, car si vous le fassiez
du pincel, il seroit trop epais et ne pourroit secher.”

Having established that the vernix is sandarac, the “vernice
liquida'’ of Cennino, and of the early Italians, is known to us.
Mrs. Merrifield in her translation of this authorl refers in a note
to this fact. Cennino, therefore, gives the receipt for making the
‘⁶ vernice liquida’' in the 151 cap. He singularly also shows that
the Italians were aware of the action of metallic oxides as driers.
The directions are for making a merdant, perfect for walls, pictures‚
upon glass, or iron, or anywhere.

‘⁴ Take your oil, cooked at the fire, or in the sun, by the mode
which 1 have before shown you. Grind with this oil a little white
and verdigris3 and when you have ground them as with water, put
a little vernice into it and allow all to boil together a little.'’

It appears to me that this passage has never been rightly read,
the word “vernice,” by which Cennino intended sandarac, having
been accepted as ‘⁴ varnish” or the “ vernice liquida'' itselfi The
white (carbonate of lead) and verdigrise, carbonate of copper,
acting as driers. Van Eyck could not have therefore invented
“driers'' for the oils or varnishes used for pigments more than he
did the use of these materials themselves It is my endeavour
here to ascertain and expose the materials universally employed
in the studio previously to the time of Van Eyck. What that
painter probably did invent, I have endeavoured to show in the
Preface to this work,

Cennino speaks of “ vernice liquida” in several places, yet he
gives no mode of making it unaccompanied by driers.
