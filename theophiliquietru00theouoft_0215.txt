similar breadth and a length of a little more than two feet.
You will then beat up clay strongly with water and horse
litter, so that three parts may be clay and a fourth dung.
With which, being well beaten together, you will mix dry
hay, making of it long flat pieces, and you will cover the
arch of rods, inside and outside, to the thickness of a fist, and
in the middle above you leave a round opening through
which you can put your hand3 make for yourself also three
iron bars of the thickness of a finger, and of such length
that they may traverse the breadth of the furnace, in which, on
both sides, make three heles, so that you can place and with-
draw them when you wish. Then place fire and wood in the
furnace until it is dried.

CHAPTER XXIII.

How GLASS MAY BE BURNT.

ΙΝ the mean time make an iron tablet for yourself of the size
of the furnace inside, two fingers in length and two in breadth
excepted, upon which you will sift quick-lime‚ or (wood)
ashes, the thickness of a straw, and¹ (arrange them) with a
flat piece of wood that they may lie firmly. The same tablet
will have an iron handle by which it can be carried and placed
and withdrawn. Lay the painted glass carefully upon it,
joined together so that on the outer part, towards the handle,
you place the green and sapphire‚ and on the inner the white,
yellow, and purple, which is the most resisting against the fire,
and thus, the bars being put in, place the tablet upon them.
Then take beech wood, well dried in the smoke, and light a
small fire in the samace, afterwards larger, with great pre-
cantion, until you see the flame rise at the back and on both
sides between the furnaee and the tablet, and by passing over
the glass cover it, as if in licking it, until at length it glows3
immediately withdrawing the wood, carefully close the mouth
