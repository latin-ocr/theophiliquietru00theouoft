heads of the nails appear above, so that when the stops are
withdrawn from the sounding instruments, they cannot be
quite extracted. These things being thus arranged, these two
pieces of wood, which perfect the organ house, are joined to-
gether with cheese—glue3 then those parts which are joined
,over the stops, in which the holes exist, are also pared round
carefully, and scraped.

CHAPTER LXXXIII.

OF THE BELLOWS.

ΙΝ making the wind-chamber, join together two pieces of wood
of the plane tree, in the above mode, of one foot in length, one
of which may be a palm thick, the other three fingers, and let
them be round at one end, like a shield, and there a foot and
a half wide, at the other end blunt, a palm in breadth. When
these have been carefully fitted together, cut, in the round
front in the thicker wood, the openings which you wish, ac-
cording to the number of the bellows, and in the blunt end .
one, which must be larger. Then cut, from each opening, a
hollow leading to the larger opening, through which the wind
may have way to the working bellows; and you will thus
glue these woods together with the cheese-glue, and you will
bind them round with a linen eloth, new and strong, which
you anoint with the same casein glue that it may adhere: you
also make strong iron bindings tinned over within and with-
out, that they may not become disunited from the woodwork‚
these you will fix on with long nails, headed and tinned‚ so
that between two openings a binding may exist, which may
include each wood from the upper to the lower side. Then
procure for yourself a curved piece of oak wood, sound and
strong, which must have at one end, from the curve, the
length of one foot, in the other of two, which you will pierce
in each end with a large auger, with which the middle por-
tions are pierced in the wheels of ploughs. But because the
openings cannot meet together, on account of the curve, make
