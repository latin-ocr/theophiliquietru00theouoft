68 NOTES ¹ro Boox 1.

Therefore, fernis or vernix is a direct and primitive term for
sandarac; and, secondly, glassa is a comparative term for the same
resin.

Tingry, in his work on varnishes ¹, states thatjuniper and san-
darac resins are still called “mentiz” by the Germans, so that
another proof of the German origin of Theophilus may be adduced.

Lessing, founding his opinion upon the derivation which the
Bollandists ² gave to the German ‘⁶ firniss,’' saw that word in the
“ fornis ” of Theophilus, thus strongly corroborating the last
assertion.

'I have elsewhere given extracts from the MS. published by
Muratori in which the word “ gumma” implies sandarac. See
note, Oleum.

Peter of St. Audemar³ gives several recipes for the manufacture
of varnish for metallic leaves.

“Oleum delini semine et pice uno pondere mixtum, et eamdem
mensuram de ‘ vernix’ pone in ollam et fac bullire bene. Deinde
mitte folia stanni bene verniciata‚ intus, et postmodum siccata ad
solem.” (Qu. vernicia intus et sicca, διο.)

“ Linseed oil and resin being mixed in equal weight, and the
same measure of ‘ ve1·nix‚' place them in a pot and boil them well.
Then place the leaves of tin, well varnished‚ inside, 'and afterwards
dried in the sun.” (Qu. inside, varnish well and dry afterwards, Sec.)

Again,—

‘⁶ Oleum lineum et medianam corticem nigri pruni mitte in
ollam novam ac fac bene bullire super carbones vel claro igne
paulatim. Deinde munda, ‘glassam tuam’ quantum volueris in
pondere et pone in alteram ollam, et aluminis quasi mediam
partem et sanguinis draconis, et omnia haec mitte in ollam, et ad
ultimum mixtum, picem adjunge et bene funde, et quam citius haec
omnia fundentur appone supradictum oleum, et secundum unctionem
confectionis, et sine bene bullire simul, et saepe move, et post mo-
dum mitiges ungulam tuam et temptabis utrum bonum sit an non.”

In a third recipe “ white thus³⁹ and resin are used instead of glassa,
with linseed or hempseed οὓ, “ oleum de lino vel de canapo.”

one of the best painters in the world, “ Michelino de Vesuci0‚
