colours, and should it become darker, you will wash it twice
or thrice with water, or even more, and so it will be improved
in two or three days, you can allow the glaire to remain; but
the more often you shall change it the better it will be. You
can likewise temper azure with white of egg, by rubbing with
the finger in a small vessel until sufficient, and you will
afterwards wash it with water, and being dry you put pure
glaire to it, and you will again wash it after two or three
days, on account of the stale egg turning it black, and spread

it until it has become dry, because of the moisture from the
water.

OF THE TEMPERING OF COLOURS.

THE “ blue of the Saracens ’' is good. Also another ‘⁴ Ro-
man blue,'' and another called “ indigo.” Greek green,
green earth, vermilion, minium, white of Apulia, bone white,
and white lead, brisil, orpiment‚ ochre, saffron, sinoper, the
preparation of brunus, gypsum, folium.

Roman azure can be mixed with white of Apulia: it can
likewise be put to orpiment‚ and it forms a yellow green.
Likewise, if you put brisil to it, it will be purple: also, if you
put vermilion it will be “brunus.'' Greek green can be
mixed with white of Apulia, both tempered with wine, and
both of them with. egg, and thus a whitish green will be
made: also, if you put saffron into green it will be a green-
ish yellow, however, if the saffron be tempered with wine,
add white if you wish it. Green earth, after the same
manner, excepting that it is ground with water, and glaire is
afterwards placed in it.

In vermilion, should you mix white, it will make carmine;
if you mix Roman blue it will be brunus: white of Apulia can
be mixed with blue alone, and again with blue and brisil, and
again with Roman azure3 it can also be mixed with green
earth. Bone white can be mixed with orpiment‚ which
mixture cannot otherwise be made, this white is therefore

necessary to painters.
