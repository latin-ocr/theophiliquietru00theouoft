xxiv PREFAOE.

“ Vienna, 5th Sept. 1846.

“ The chapters which are wanting in your manu-
script, and of which you have requested a copy, are
equally absent from both our manuscripts, although
they figure in the index; in this respect, therefore, our
MSS. are exactly conformable to the printed text.”—
( The Edition of Leiste and Lessiny.)

“I have the pleasure of remitting you the fac-simile
of the first page of our most ancient manuscript, (of
the twelfth century,) which you likewise requested,
and which, at my request, my colleague, M. Ernest
Birk, proficient in this art, has had the kindness to
transcribe.”

This fac-simile Ι have caused to be placed at the
commencement of the work, as it belongs apparently to
the most ancient copy of Theophilus known, one of the
twelfth century, and it bears the name of RUGERUS.

For how can we reconcile the conflicting opinions of
Lessing and Leiste? Lessing affirms the Wolfenbiittel
MS. to be of the eleventh, Leiste, of the tenth cen-
tury3 both Lessing and Leiste assign the thirteenth or
fourteenth century as the date of the Leipsic manu-
script ; Leiste himself was undecided, as the following
passage will prove. Comparing the manuscripts of
” Wolfenbiittel and Leipsic‚ he writes, “Beyde sind in
yross Quart auf Peoyamen yesckroe'eben‚ und ‘qlez'chen sich
sehr in den Schriflzilyen, so dass man sie waltrscbeinliclz
in ein J alzrlmndert versetzen* muss.”l

Paleographical knowledge has much increased since

“ Both are written in large quarto on parchment, and resemble
each other much in the written character; it appears, therefore,
that they must be placed in one and the same century.”
