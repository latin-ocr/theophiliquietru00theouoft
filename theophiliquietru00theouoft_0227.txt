take sapphire and green glass, which melts at the beat of a
slight flame, grinding carefully with water upon the porphyry
stone, and with a pencil paint a thin stroke over the fracture.
Then place it upon the iron slab, and raise the glass a little
upon that side where the fracture is, that the flame may pass
over it equally, and so place it in the oven used for windows,
laying under it dry beech-wood and fire, by degrees, until the
vase grows hot with the ashes in it, and immediately augment
the fire that the flame *may increase. And when you see that
it has nearly become red, removing the wood, carefully close
the mouth of the furnace and the upper opening, until it is
altogether cold. The vase being taken out, remove the ashes,
without water: and so you will wash it and keep it for what-
ever service you may wish,

OF RINGS.

Rmos are also made from glass in this manner. Arrange for
yourself a very small furnace in the above fashion, and some
small cups3 thenvprocure ashes, salt, powder of copper and
lead. These things arranged, choose the colours of the glass
which you wish, and fire and wood being placed under, heat
them. In the mean time procure for yourself a piece of wood,
a palm in length and a finger in breadth, and upon one-third
part of it place a wooden wheel the breadth of a palm, so
that you may hold two parts of the wood in your hand, and
let the wheel remain above your hand firmly fastened to the
wood, and let a third part of the wood show itself above the
wheel. This wood must be cut thin at the extremity, and be
so joined in an iron, as a lance is joined in its pike, and this
iron must have the length of a foot, to which the wood is
joined, so that at the junction it may be even with the wood,
and from this place it may be more slender, diminishing to-
wards the end, where it must be quite pointed. And near
the window of the furnace on the right side, that is, on your
left, let a piece of wood stand, the thickness of an arm, dug
