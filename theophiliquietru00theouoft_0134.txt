64 NOTES To ssoox 1.

and the varnish of Theophilus, the writer is seen combating with
his error : he evades the text, supposes mistake in the given quan-
tity and imperfect description as to the mode of making the var-
nish, questioning the intentioris of his author, in order to render
his own idea tenable.

The followers of Raspe, who see the Latin “Glessum’' and
“ Amber‚” in the word, ‘⁶ glassa‚'' are still more liable to the same
physical objections ; it would be found impossible to dissolve any
portion of amber by strictly adhering to the directions given by
Theophilus in c. 21, and it is indispensably required that a pro-
posed resin strictly fulfils this condition.

On reading our author, the description given of the resin em-
ployed is clear: “et adde gummi (Arabici, Cod. R.) quod vocatur
fornis, minutissime tritum, quod habet speciem lucidissimi thuris,
sed cum frangitur fulgorem clariorem reddit.” It is impossible
that Theophilus, “presbyter et monachus,” and therefore neces-
sarily familiarly acquainted with “ Thus,” or “ Frankincense‚” as
used for incense, could compare with it any resin but one which
closely resembled it in outward appearance3 in such a case of
comparison, the clear and concise writing of Theophilus, upon all
the practical subjects on which he treats, absolves him from care-
lessness, and even did the question rest upon this comparative
evidence alone, copal or amber are entirely out of the ques-
tion, neither possessing points of appearance in common with
“ Thus.”

It was therefore necessary in the first place, in order to deter-
mine the gum resin of Theophilus, to fix upon one which bore a
strong external resemblance to “ Thus.’' The fine specimens of
the Arabic sandarac, which exactly resemble the choice “ Thus,” viz.
the T. masculinum, corticosum, and feminoeum of the ancients‚
pointed out that resin,*f0r it has the distinguishing mark, a bright
glassy fracture, which the Thus has not3 or, as Theophilus writes,
“ sed, cum frangitur, fulgorem clariorem reddit.”

But the term ‘⁴ fornis ” which is given to the resin will still
more strongly designate Sandarach, if it can be shown that this
name has been applied to that gum resin.

In the second process given by Theophilus for making the
‘⁶ Gluten Vernition,” he calls the same gum fornis ‘⁴ Glassa,’'
“ supra dictum gummi fornis, quod Romane glassa dicitur,''
(“ aliter Arabicum‚” an interpolation in the Cod. Royal, Paris.)
