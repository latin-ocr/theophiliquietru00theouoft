CHAPTER XI.

OF FLASKS WITH A LONG NECK.

ΒΗΤ if you wish to make fiasks with a long neck act thus.
When you have blown the hot glass in the form of a large
bladder, close the opening of the tube with your thumb so
that the air may not escape, swinging the tube, with the glass
which hangs from it, above your head, in such a manner as
if you wished to throw it off, and presently, its neck being
extended in length, your hand being raised upright, allow the
tube, with the vase below it, to hang down, that the neck
may not become curved; and thus separating it with a moist
piece of wood, place it in the cooling oven. -

CHAPTER XII.

OF DIVERS COLOURS OF GLASS, NOT TRANSPARENT.

IN the ancient edifices of the Pagans, different kinds of glass
are found in mosaic work, namely, white, black‚ green,
yellow, sapphire, red, and purple3 it is not clear, but opaque,
like marble, and they are like square stones5 from which
coloured 'gems are made in gold, silver, and brass work, of
which we speak fully in their proper place. Divers small
vases are also found, of the same colours‚ which the Freneh,
most intelligent in this work, collect, and some melt the
sapphire in their furnaces, adding to it a little clear and white
glaSS, and make costly plates of sapphire‚ and very useful in
windows. They work also from the purple and green in a
similar manner.
