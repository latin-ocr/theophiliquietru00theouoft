Prepared crystal glass, lo rb.

Scales of copper, -l part by weight to 20 parts by weight of
crystal.

1 oz. yellow oxide ofiron. (croci ferri.)

Grind, and place it in the furnace.

Take the tartar of red wine, thick, and hard to break, 3 parts.

Prepared crystal glass, 2 parts.

Then take 20 parts by weight of this, and 1 part by weight
of scale of copper.

Yellow oxide of iron, ὲ an oz. (croci ferri.)

Grind this together with red wine, place it in the furnace,

This bi-tartrate of potash, which was used as extensively as the
borate of soda is now, in the composition of a flux for glass, and
in the preparation of pigmen ts, here serves to deoxidize the “ scale‚’'
or red oxide of copper ¹, and the red colour is evolved. Other
substances containing carbon are serviceable for this purpose.

“ The scale of copper is thus prepared. Take as much copper
scaleas you wish, and grind it well, and dissolve it in vinegar, (in
aceto,) and pass it through a filter, (distilla per filtrum ²‚) and you
can do this again, as above, and that which is strained you inspis-
sate, and grind it well to your fancy. And you can do thus with
scales of iron 3 and yellow of iron is treated in a similar manner.”

“ Zaffer (zaffira) is thus purified t—Take 2 oz. of it and grind
it well upon porphyry, with acidulous water, after the sashion of
the above colourS, for four honrs, and lay it out to dry; add water
when it is wanted in grinding.”

' Numerous errors appear to have arisen from not distinguishing the phrase “dis-
tiuare per filtrum'’ from “ distillare‚” by which latter was intended “ distillare per
alembicum,'‘ or to distil.
