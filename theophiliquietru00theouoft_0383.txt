CHAPTER LXVII.

OF THE PURIFICATION OF COPPER.

TAKE an iron dish of the size you wish, and line it in-
side and out with clay strongly beaten and mixed, and it is
carefully dried. Then place it before a forge upon the coals,
so that when the bellows act upon it the wind may issue
partly within and partly above it, and not below it. And
very small coals being placed round it, place the copper in it
equally, and add over it a heap of coals.· When, by blowing
a long time, this has become melted, uncover it and cast im-
mediately fine ashes of eoals over it, and stir it with a thin
and dry piece of wood as if mixing it, and you will directly
see the burnt lead adhere to these ashes like a glue. Which
being cast out again superpose coals, and blowing for a long
time, as at first, again uncover it, and then do as you did be-
fore. You do this until at length by cooking it you can
withdraw the lead entirely. Then pour it over the mould -
which you have prepared for this, and you will thus prove if it
be pure. Hold it with the pincers, glowing as it is, before it has
become cold, and strike it with a large hammer strongly over
the auvil, and if it be broken or split‚ you must liquefy it
anew as before. If, however, it should remain sound, you
will cool it in water, and you cook other (copper) in the same
manner. This copper is called burnt. From this copper
you can work whatever you may wish to make, for gssding, in
ductile work, in figures and animals and birds, in censers and
different vases, in borders of tablets‚ in wires and chains.
Make auricalcum from this copper with the addition of cala-
mine, in the same manner as you have composed the brass of
caldrons above. When you have recooked this four or five
times in small vessels* placed in the furnace, whatever you

have cast from it in a variety of divers work, you can gild
in the best manner.
