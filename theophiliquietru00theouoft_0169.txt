become too solid, for there is peseri which is very quickly pre- i l
pared, and other more slowly. When it has the consistence of ¹
honey it will be good3 if you allow it to thicken more, you can ἱἕ
neither mix it with other substances, nor spread it over pictures ἴ
srnoothly. You will therefore be careful to cover it every even- J

ing, or to take it into the house, for the dew of the night injures J

it. When it has arrived at a suitable state, you will pass it ἱ
through a eloth to free it from hairs or insects which may have s*
soiled it, and you will then have peseri baked in the sun.’'

Peseri is likewise, in the same MS„ directed in the preparation
of a ground for paintings.

I have here only quoted from the old part of the manuscript,
the different recipes at the conclusion of the first book having
been added from time to time, some of them being as late as the
sixteenth century.

The Sloane MS. 17 54, “ De coloribus illuminatorum sive picto-
rum,'’ and which is of the fourteenth century, speaks of oil as a
vehicle for colours upon wood or plaster.

In the Le Begue MS.‚ also, “ Frater Dionysius,” “ J ohannes de
Modena‚’' ‘⁶ Petrus de Sancto Audemaro,” also speak of oil to be
used with certain colours, as white, grecus, blues, blacks, reds, and
yellow, upon wood or plaster.

John Le Begue himself, who was born in 1368, who finished his
collection relating to the arts in 1431, and who must have been
forty-two years of age at the time when, according to Vasari, the
first picture in oil was painted by the inventor, Van Eyck, gives
directions for preparing oil for painting. I give the old French
receipt: “ Si vous voulez appareiller oile pour detremper toutes
manieres de couleurs, prenez chaux vive, avec autant de ceruse
comme est l'oile. Puis mettez au soleil et ne le mouvez jusques
ὲ un mois ou plus, car quand plus y sera et mieulx vandra. Puis
le coulez et gardez tres bien l’oile, et de cette oile gardee et ainsi
preparee pouvez detremper toutes couleurs ensemble et chacun
par soy.”

Also Le Begue speaks of the oils of linseed, hempseed and
walnuts as fit for painting:

‘⁶ Si vous voulez rougir tables au aultres choses, prennez oile de
lin, de chauvre‚ ou de noix‚ et melez avec mine ou sinope sur un'e
pierre et sans eau. Puis enluminez a un pincel ceque vous voulez
rougir.” Art. 335.

Le Begue gives a curious recipe for a glutinous preparation
