NOTES To BOOK 1. 59

torum sive Pictorum‚”l and which treatise is of Greek origin, in-
forms us that ‘⁴ Motella quaedam herba est in terra Sancti Egidii.
Ex hac herba tria grana in semine exeunt. Et exhiis granis telae
tinguntur, sicque murum colorem reddunt qui color ‘folium’
dicitur.” Morella is a certain plant in the country of St. Giles
(Athens). And from this plant three grains proceed in the seed.
From these grains cloths are dyed and thus render a mulberry
colour‚ which colour is called folium.

1 give an extract from a MS. belonging to the ‘⁴ Bibliotheque
Royale at Montpellier,’' of the early part of the fifteenth century,
kindly lent to me for inspection by M. Libri of the Sorbonne, with
permission to make any extracts relating to the arts. This MS.
belonged to Cardinal Alberti, and is a collection of medical recipes,
&c. It contains a notice upon the materiale and processes used
in the arts‚ which appears to be drawn from the Byzantine source 3
it is entitled, “Liber diversarium artium.” Ι give the extract
upon folium. “ De natura et distemperatione ‘ folii ’ seu ‘ morellae.’ ’'
“ Quaedam herba est in terra Sancti OEgidii, ex hac herba tria
grana in semine exeunt, sicque mirum colorem reddunt, qui color
folium dicunt, qui color sic distemperatur. Pannum folii scindes
et fissura in coquilla pones, postea sic fundes claram ovi et sine
maturescere, et fit purpureus. Distempera solium urina, tempe-
rata cum aquatepida, vel curn lexivia per noctem unam3 deinde
projicietur et distemperatur curn claro recenti3 adhibe modicum
calcis. Confectio folium; in frusta nimis tenuia et modica inci-
datur-3 et glutine casei preparato, distemperatur 3 et sic permittatur
donec bene permixtum sit.’'

‘⁶ Of the nature and tempering of ‘ folium,’ or ‘ mulberry
colour.”’ ‘⁶ It is a certain plant in the country of St. Giles, from
this plant in seed three grains proceed, and so yield a beautiful
colour, which colour they call ⁴ folium‚' and which is thus tem-
pered. You cut up the eloth of folium, (dyed with folianu) and
place the shreds in a small vessel, afterwards you pour the white
of egg over it and leave it to mature, and a purple is made. Temper
folium with urine, mixed with warm water, or with a lixivium,
during one night3 it is then poured out and tempered with fresh
glaire (of egg); put a little lime to it. A preparation of folium;
it is cut up into pieces, iery thiu and small, and is tempered with
prepared glue of cheese3 and it is thus left until it has well mixed

together.”
