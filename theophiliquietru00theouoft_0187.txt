PREFACE To THE SECOND noox. 117

Ι, desiring to be the imitator of this man, have
approached the poreh of holy Sophia, and beheld the
chaneel filled with every variety of divers eoloms, and
showing forth the nature and utility of each. From
which, having forthwith entered with unwatched foot-
step, I filled up the storehouse of my heart fully, out
of all; which I have set forth with clearness, having, by
careful experiment, thoroughly examined one by one
for your study, all these things sufficiently approved by
the eye and hands, without jealousy. But since the
practice of this kind of embellishmeut cannot be of
quick apprehension‚ like a diligent inquirer I have
greatly laboured to inform myseli', by all methods, what
invention of art and variety of colour may beautify a
structure and not repe] the light of day and the rays of
the sun. Applyiug myself to this exercise‚ I comprise
the nature of glass, and Ι consider that this can be
effected by the use and variety of it alone. This art,
as seen and reported I have learned, I have laboured,
for your observanee‚ to fathom.
