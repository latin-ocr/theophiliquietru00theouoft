now called moulds. You place these, perfectly dry, at the
fire, and when they have become warm‚ pour out the melted
wax into water, and you again place them at the fire, and you
do thus until you have removed all the wax. After this you
lay large and cold 00315 111 3 fit and smooth place, upon which
you establish the moulds with the openings turned down-
wards, and you place around them some hard stones which
cannot fly to pieces by the heat of the fire, and you will
arrange them stone upon stone like a wall, dry without mor-
tar, so that between the stones many small openings may re-
main. These being thus arranged, higher by half a foot than
are the moulds, spread around the hot 00315, 31111 111011 1110
00111, 111110 1110 top, and take care that 511011 space be between
the moulds and the stones as may contain the coals. When
all the coals are glowing, they are sometimes to be stirred
with a thin wood on every side through the openings between
the stones, that they may be closed together, and the heat be
equal everywhere. And when they have descended so much
that you can see the moulds, again fill up to the top with cold
coals, and do thus a third time. And when you see the
moulds glow outside, place the vessel in the fire with the ,
brass which you wish to 0351, 31111 you will blow slightly at
first, then more and more until it be quite liquefied. This being
done, carefully stir it with an instrument bent and fixed in
wood, 31111 turn it into another wide (vessel)‚ again fill it with
brass and heat it, and do thus until the vessel be filled, and
you will again stir it with the curved instrument and will
purge it from coals, and blowing strongly with the bellows
you will cover it with large coals. The stones being then
removed, you take the moulds from the fire and carefully
plaster clay, plentifully sprinkled with water and thinned like
1005, with a eloth, and so a trough being made near the 1111·-
11300 111 which you found, you place in the moulds and heap
up earth on every side and carefully compress it with a piece
of wood 1131 31 1110 bottom, by frequently pounding it. And
directly have ready a small eloth many times folded and
placed in a piece of split wood, and the vessel being taken
from the fire with the pincers curved at the „end‚ and the
small eloth being applied which can defend it from dust and
