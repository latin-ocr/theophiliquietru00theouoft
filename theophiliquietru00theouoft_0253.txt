mented with a cross can be but one of the three Divino personages:
this, adds M. Didron, is the invariable rule.

Until the eleventh century the Latin chureh, as well as the Greek,
fraternized with the Jewish religion. An enamelled cross of the
Abbey of Saint Bertin, a romaic cross of the eleventh century,
gives the nimbus, the character of saint, to Moses, to his brother
Aaron, to the prophet who marks the elect with the ‘⁶ thau,” to
Isaac, ‘to Joshua and Caleb. But at the moment of the consum-
mation of the schism, this respect, which the Latin church formerly
entertained for the personages of the Old Testament, sensibly di-
minished3 the Byzantine influence, alone, partially preserved it,
but in the fourteenth century the Christian saints only kept this
attribute. The Greeks continue the practice unto this dayl.

C. XXX. QUOMODO REFORMETUR VAS VITREUM
FRACTUM.

This invention appears to have been made in the reign of
Tiberius Caesar, and to have led to the fable of malleable glass.
Pliny, who has been quoted by St. Isidore, mentions an invention
of a composition, or tempering, which rendered glass tender, and
that Tiberius, fearing this would depreciate the value of the
precious metals, abolished the workshop of the artificer. This
story has been wonderfully improved by St. Isidore, who adds a
hammer to the tale, and converts the “ tender” or “ tractable glass ’'
mentioned by Pliny into one which is “ malleable.'' Eraclius
quotes from St. Isidore, rather than from Pliny, whose version is
too plain to admit of the marvellous.

Pliny writes, “ Ferunt, Tiberio principe, excogitatum vitri tem-
peramentum, ut flexibile esset: et totam officinam artificis ejus
abolitam, ne oeris, argenti, auri, metallis pretia detraherentur:
eaque fama crebrior diu, quam certior fuit.”2

St. Isidore, disregarding the doubt expressed by Pliny, that
glass could even be rendered more tractable, writes ³—“ It is re-
lated that, under Tiberius Caesar, an artificer invented a tempering
for glass, which rendered it tender and ductile ( flexibile et ductile),
