things often happen through carelessness or negligence, or ig-
norance or unskilfulness of the founder, when it is cast either

too hot or too eold, or in too great haste, or too slowly. When
you have considerately and cautiously cast it, should you
perceive a fault of this kind in it, carefully sculp it out with
the instrument fit for this work, if you can. But should the
bubble or fissure be of such depth that you cannot dig it out,
you must again melt it, and so until it is become sound. When
it has become so, see beforehand that the anvils and your
hammers, with which you should work, are quite smooth and
polished3 and take care that the gold or silver plate be
so equally thinned everywhere, that it be in no place thicker
than in another. And when it has been thinned so that the
nail, slightly pressed upon it, may show upon the other side,
and it is perfectly sound, directly portray the figures you may
wish‚ according to your will. You design, also, in vthat part
which is seen to be the most sound and beautiful, gently how—
ever, and so that it may slightly appear on the other side.
You will then with a curved iron, well polished, gently rub
the head, in the first place, which must be more raised; and
so turning the plate upon the right side you will rub around
the head, also with the smooth and polished iron, so that the
ground may descend and the head be raised, and you directly
beat around the head with a middling sized hammer upon the
anvil, gently, and you thus cook it before the furnace, until it
glows‚ coals being superposed in that place. Which being
done, and the plate cooled by itself, you will again rub it
with the eurved instrument on the underneath part, inside
the hollow of the head, slightly and carefully, and turning
the plate you will again rub with the smooth iron upon the
upper part, and you depress the ground that the relief of the
head may be raised, and again gently striking it with the
middling hammer about this, you recook it, by applying the
coals; and thus you act often, by carefully raising it inside
and outside and frequently hammering, as often cooking
until the relief is brought to the height of three or four fingers,
or more or less, according to the number of the figures. If,
however, the gold or silvei· is yet somewhat too thick, you
