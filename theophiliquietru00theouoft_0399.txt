the dregs of beer, moderately thick, with which mixture you
cover all the silver which you may wish should remain white,
and that which is to be gilt can remain bare. When you
shall have dried this over the embers, you will gild the places
one by one without water, being gut, you will wash it, and
polished, you will colour it. Then with finely pulverized
charcoal, and with pieces of wood, larger and smaller, you
will rub it carefully until it be equally bright everywhere.
You afterwards make the fine lines, both on the gold and
on the silver, which in the making you likewise polish, until you
bring it to pei-fection. When you wish to affix these gold or
silver plates fully relieved and polished‚ take wax and melt it
in an earthenware or copper vessel, and mix tile, finely ground,
with it, or sand, so that there may be two parts of this and a
third of wax. When this has been likewise melted, you
will strongly stir it with a wooden spoon, and fill up all the
figures with it in gold, silver, or copper, or whatever may
have been relieved in these, and cold, you will attach it where
you wish. Also in copper plates, thinned in the same manner,
the like work is made, but with greater attention and care as
to strength, as its nature is more hard. When this work has
been brought to the fine lines, it should be cleaned on the
outside part with a woollen eloth and sand‚ until the black
coat be taken off, and so be gilt and polished, and the draw-

ings being finished, be coloured and filled with the above
mentioned composition.

upper side. In these are sculptured‚ in resemblance of seals,
