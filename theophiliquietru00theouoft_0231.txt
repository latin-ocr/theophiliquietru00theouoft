· ΘΒΑῙΝΒ of sand (or silica,) and natron (or the carbonates of potash
and soda‚) having been known from the earliest period, it is pro-
bable that the origin of glass would date from the highest anti-
qulty.

The Egyptians had at a remote period heated these alkaline
silicates in contact with the metallic oxides, at Thebes and Mem-
phis, and in their temple of ‘⁶ Ptha ”“ οι· Fire, devoted to the prac-
tice of their occult chemical arts ¹.

‘⁴ 1 have often found in the ruins of ancient cities of the
Thebaid,'' writes M. Roziere, “ amongst the fragments of coloured
glass with which they abound, some pieces tinted with various
colours. Many of them, affording in some of their parts, beautiful
tints of purple, were, Ι think, remains of the ancient artificial
‘⁴ vasa murrhina ”—frits, glasses, enamels, are also found, coloured
by metallic oxides ².

The Phoenicians having traded in the glass of Thebes, became
themselves famous in the art of its manufacture. The tale of the
fortuitous discovery of glass by them, related by Pliny ³, and fre-
quently quoted, is stated by Merret‚ upon the authority of the
most experienced, to be impossible, as even by the most violent
fire glass cannot be made, in any quantity, by burning substances‚
fit for its composition, in the open air.
