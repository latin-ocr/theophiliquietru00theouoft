and churches and chapels of all sects is becoming every
day stronger; we appear anxious at last to throw off
the title acquired by us, in common with the Turks, of
“lovers of whitewash‚’' as if in that practice simplicity
was ensured.

There are sterile periods in history, as in years, which
are succeeded by those of fertility3 from the seed which
is being scattered to-day we may reap a rich harvest
which may help to nourish industry‚ commerce and art,
and, by tending to impress new directions and tastes‚
may aid in dispelling a portion, at least, of the darkness
which opposes the progress of the mass of human intel-
ligence. ·

Ιη concluding my labours, the kindness of the several
gentlemen to whom I have had occasion to apply‚
Ι during the progress of this work, demands my liveliest
recognition.

At Vienna, Dr. F erdinand Wolf: at Paris, MM.
Libri, Champollion, and the Count de l’Escalopier
united to forward the views of a stranger with a promp-
titude honourable to them in the service of literature.

At home, Sir Frederick Madden‚ Signor Panizzi and
Mr. Eastlake, have likewise aided my exertionS, by at-
tentions and kindness, which have often, in the midst
of difficulties, encouraged and cheered labours which
by the concurrent sympathy of so many enliglitened
men, I have felt were not pursued without a prospect
of advantage to the public.
