PREFACE

THE SECOND BOOK.

IN the preceding book, dearest brother, through a
disposition of sincere affection, I have not hesitated
to convey to your virtuous disposition how much honour
and perfection there is in avoiding indolence, and in
contemning ignorance and sloth3 and how sweet and
agreeable it is to indulge in the exercise of divers use-
fulness after the word of a certain author, who says :—

“ To know anything is praiseworthy3 it is a fault to be unwilling
to learn.”

Nor let any one be slow to understand him, concerning
whom Solomon has said, “ He that increaseth know-
ledge increaseth labour,'’ because whoever carefully

meditates may mark what perfection of mind and body
may result from it.

For it is evident3 clearer than the light3 because
whoever gives his mind to sloth and levity, also indulges
in vain trifles, and slander, curiosity, drinking, orgies,
quarrel, fight, homicide, excess, thefts, sacrileges, per-
jury, and other things of this kind, which are repugnant
in the eyes of God, overlooking the humble and quiet
man, working in silence in the name of the Lord, and
obedient to the precept of the holy Apostle Paul:
“ But rather let him labour, workiny with his hands the
- chiny which is qood, that he may have to qive to kivi that

needeth.’'
