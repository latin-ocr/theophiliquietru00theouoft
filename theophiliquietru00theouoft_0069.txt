PREFACE. li

Wherefore, gentle son, whom God has rendered per.
fectly happy in this respect, that those things are of.
fered to thee gratis which many, ploughing the sea.
waves with the greatest danger to life, consumed by
the hardship of hunger and cold, or subjected to the
weary servitude of toachers, and altogether worn out
by the desire of learning, yet acquire with intolerable
labour, covet with greedy looks this “ ΒοοΚ or VARIOUS-
ARTs,'’ read it through with a tenacious memory, em-
brace it with an ardent love.

Should you carefully peruse this, you will there find
out whatever Greece possesses in kinds and mixtures of
various colours; whatever Tuscany knows of in mosaic
work, or in variety of enamel; whatever Arabia shows
forth in work of fusion, ductility, or chasing3 whatever
Italy ornaments with gold, in diversity of vases and
sculpture of gems or ivory; whatever France loves in
a costly variety of windows; whatever industrious
Germany approves in work of gold, silver, copper and
iron, of woods and of stones.

When you shall have re-read this often, and have
committed it to your tenacious memory, you shall thus
recompense me for this care of instruction, that as often
as you shall successfully have made use of my work,
you pray for me for the pity of Omnipotent God, who
knows that I have written these things, which are here
arranged, neither through love of human approbation,
nor through desire of temporal reward, nor have I
stolen anything precious or rare through envious jea-
lousy, nor have I kept back anything reserved for
myself alone; but in augmentation of the honour and
glory of His name, Ι have consulted the progress and
hastened to aid the necessities of many men.
