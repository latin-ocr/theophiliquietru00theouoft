NOTES To Boox 11. 189

upon this foundation were superadded the pure and vigorous
outline, and simple, elegant conception of the early Italian artists‚
the art appears to have reached a climax which it must have
required an influence, as powerful as perverse, to depress.

The unfortunate rivality which existed between the glass and
the oil painters appears to have had no small share in this; anxious
to excel and emulative of accomplishing what had previously been,
apparently, unattempted, the glass painters wandered from the
legitimate conditions of their art in striving to rival the delicacy
and gradations os the air tints, which they so much admired in the
productions of their brother artists, totally forgetting that the
means by which their works were rendered visible, a transmitted
light, demanded a treatment so widely different. The experience
of the past was neglected‚ and the art gradually sank, only to be
revived by a return to the practice which elevated it.
