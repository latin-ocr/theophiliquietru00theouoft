of flax, skilful in the arts and in medicine, they could not have
overlooked the production of an oil from the linseed nor have
been ignorant of its peculiar properties.

In the British Museum are stone sculptured figures which are
Egyptian, and have been painted with an unctuous vehicle which
appears to have been oil. Two seated figures painted in different
colours, one of them red, particularly show this. Compared with
the paintings on a fragment of wall opposite to these figures, and
which are also Egyptian, the difference of the vehicle can, even
at this lapse of time, be plainly observed.

Dioscorides, and the Arab writers on medicine who follow him,
speak of linseed oil.

The corruption of the word “ encaustic'' has already been re-
marked, ‘⁴ see Incaustum ς ” and the signature “ }›·÷‘nasv,’' ¹ or
‘⁴ enecausen,” of the Greek artists, might well lose its orignal sig-
nification in painting also; the term remaining while the process

changed. Pamphilus, the master of ApelleS‚ is stated to have in·
troduced many novelties into the art3 he is asserted by Pliny to
have painted in a different style from former painters and to have ²

been in the habit of painting' small tablet pictures ². These re-
marks, however vague, coupled with the invention of the “ atra-
mentum ’' of his pupil, Apelles, may cause us to enquire whether
“ 0i1” was unknown to Pamphilus?

The first mention I can find of the use of οἱ] in painting is by
Vitruvius ³, who directs that Punic wax be mixed with oil in the
preparation of walls for receiving colours, and for the application
of colours, which will not bear lime, in coating walls. This is an
encaustic process, however.

Pliny gives the same directions as Vitruvius ⁴¹. This author
likewise mentions walnut oil by the Greek term ‘⁶ Caryinum.'’⁵

The Roman writers drew their knowledge upon these subjects
from the Greeks, who were their masters in all the arts of luxury
and elegance; more inventive and theoretical than the Romans,
these propagated the literature, sciences and arts, which the latter
did but practically adopt. It is in a Greek (Byzantine) MS. that
