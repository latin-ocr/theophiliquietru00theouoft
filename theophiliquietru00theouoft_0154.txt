“Nisi fallor, minium, id est sandaracam, et album plumbum.
id est cerusa, unius naturae sunt. Si in ignem mittes cerusam,
nomen et colorem et fortitudinem accipit, quia quanto plus ustum
fuerit plus rubet, et quanto minus ustum plus pristinum colorem
retinet, id est, alborem aut pallorem 3 et ponendo ipsum in mace-

firms that Theophilus gives directions for painting in “fresca’'
The blunder of supposing all painfings, executed upon a wall, that
were not accomplished wi’th an oily vehicle‚ has been lately re-
marked elsewhere.

Theophilus mentions painting upon wall, ‘⁶ in muro,” and upon
ceiling or plaster work, “in laqueari.'’ In the former style par-
ticular colours are to be used, mixed with lime to make them
bind, “propter firmitatem,'' chap. 16. The dry wall, “murus
siccus,'’ is saturated with water, and the colours applied while it
is wet. —The whole dries together, c. 15. This was the Byzantine
mode of painting upon walls, “in humidO,” and is quite a dif-
ferent process from that known by the name of “ fresco‚'' which
was of Italian invention. When dry and firm, these paintings re-
ceived glazings of the rarer colours upon themsmixed with egg,
or Other glarea.
