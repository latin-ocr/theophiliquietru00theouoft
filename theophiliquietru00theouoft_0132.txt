62 NOTES To BOOK 1.

the Gallie is called ‘yene,’ and ‘herm’ the branches of which
being perforated or cut half through below, in the month of March,
give out a red liquor which, boiled with urine, is ‘lake,’ with
which the skins of swine are stained ε ” and again,

“ Gum lacha of the ivy is made from the juice or liquor
flowing in March from the boughs of the ivy plant, cleaving and
growing to the trees, if cut with a sharp instrument.” This will
be noticed more fully in notes to lib. 3.

The Iacca of Cennini is doubtless our “ gum-lac,'’ yet the gum—
lacha of the Greeks was more properly so called, being a true gum
not a resinous substance.

Another vegetable purple red, which will come under the head
“ Folium‚” was made from the “ Bresilium Lignum.''

“ Braxilium vel Brexilium est lignum rubeum, a quo cum pistus,
roseus sit, in lixivio forti, vel urina, cum albumine commiscetur,
exit color roseus vel purpureus.’'--Tab. Voc. Syn.

That Brazil or Bresil wood was in use at an early period for a
purple or rose coloured dye we have abundant evidence. Moses
speaks of “ rams’ skins dyed red,’'¹ 52⁸7& algom, ξύλον animnos, the
Brasile tree, according to Holyoke. This word has been rendered
in a French version of the Testament, “ jaune” as if from ‘⁶ adom”
a “ adamah,'’ terra, and therefore judged to mean “ yellom ochre.'’

The word Brasilium is probably derived from the Greek Βςάζω.

The Pseudo Santalum‚ vulgo “ Saunders wood,” from which the
red colour was obtained, is a native of the East. Huet² states
that “Sampian wood, which is the same as BrasiL comes from the
East Indies.” It doubtless found its way into Egypt bywhe Red
Sea, and thus became known to Moses, who could have taught us
much relating to the arts of the Egyptians.

Thus, contrary to the received opinion, the country Brazil has
taken from rather than given the name, to the wood which it
yielded of so fine quality and in such quantity.

Chaucer mentions Brasil wood before the discovery of the New
World.

nim nedeth not his colour for to dien,
With Brasil, ne with grain of Portingale.''
