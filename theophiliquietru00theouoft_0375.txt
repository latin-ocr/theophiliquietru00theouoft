according to the size of the censer, the middle piece, how—
ever, shorter‚ the rest longer3 openings being adapted at
both ends of the chains, you will fasten the longest of them
to the lower part of the censer with solid nails passed through
them ; joined together at the upper part, you place small rings
upon them, with which you will adjust them and fasten them
upon the lily at bottom, by which it should be carrIed in the
hand with a large ring placed upon its summit. But the middle
chain, which is shorter‚ you will fasten by a nail to the upper
part of the censer at one end, and you will adjust the other
under the lily by a ring placed below3 and you will thus
take care that the censer may hang equally on every side.
Censers of various forms and various workmanship can be
beaten and founded in gold and silver and brass, in the same
manner and fashion as we have related. But it is greatly
to be heeded that the brass, which should be gilt, be quite

pure and purged from lead, on account of divers mishaps -

which are wont to happen to the gilders. If you wish to

compose this brass, first learn the nature of copper, from
which it is made.

CoPPER'is engendered in the earth. When a vein of which
is found, it is acquired with the greatest labour by digging
and breaking. It is a stone of a green colour, and most hard
and naturally mixed with lead. This stone, dug up in abund-
ance, is placed upon a pile and burned, after the manner of
chalk, nor does it change colour, but yet loses its hardness, so
that it can be broken up. Then, being bruised small, it is placed
in the furnace; coals and the bellows being applied, it is in-
cessantly forged by day and night. This should be done
carefully and with caution3 that is, at first coals are placed
in, (¹ then small pieces of stone are distributed over them, and
