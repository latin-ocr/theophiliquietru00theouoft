make rolls of them in form of loaves‚ and placing them in the
fire, leave them until they quite glow. After they have first
burnt for a very long time and have afterwards cooled, place
a portion of them in a vessel of clay, pouring urine upon them
and stirring with wood. When it has deposed in a clear man-
ner, pour it upon the red folium, and grinding it slightly upon
a stone, add to it a fourth part of quick lime, and when it
shall be ground and sufficiently moistened, strain it through
a eloth, and paint with a pencil where you wish, thinly, after—
wards more thiekly‚ And if you wish to imitate a robe in a
page of a book, with purple folium3 with the same tempering,
without the mixture of lime, paint first with a pen, in the same
page, flourishes or circles, and in them birds or beasts, or
leaves; and when it is dry, paint red folium over all,
thinly, then more thiekly‚ and a third time if necessary3 and
afterwards paint over it some old clear of egg, beat up with-
out water. Do not grind purple or blue folium, but pour it with
the same tempering, without lime, into a shell, and stir it with
wood, and when it has stood for a night, the next day use it in
what manner you wish, paint over it with clear of egg. Paint
over also with glaire of egg, draperies, and all things which
you have painted with folium and carmine. You can likewise
preserve the burned ashes which remain, for a long time, dry.

CHAPTER XXXVI.

OF CINNABAR.
IF you *wish to make cinnabar, take sulphur, of which there
are three kinds, white, black, and yellow ; breaking which
upon a dry stone, add to it two parts of quicksilver, in equal
weight of the balance, and when you have carefully mixed it,
place it in a glass bottle, covering it all over with clay, and
close the mouth that the vapour may not exude, and put it
near the fire to dry. Then place it among the burning coals,
and presently, when it has begun to grow hot, you will hear a
noise inside, the manner in which the quieksilver combines
with the burning sulphur; and when the sound has ceased,
immediately take off the bottle, and opening it, take out the

’ co'lour.
