CHAPTER LXXIII.

OF PUNCHED WORK.

PLA'rEs are also made from copper in the above manner, and
are carved with delicate work os figures, flowers, or animals‚
and the work is so disposed that the grounds may be small,
they are then cleaned with fine sand and are polished and
coloured with instruments proper for this work. They are
afterwards punched with the punching instrument, which
is formed in this manner. An instrument is made from steel,
long as the measure of a finger, fine at one extremity, at the
other, thicker. When this has been smoothly filed at the
finer end, a small hole is struck in the middle of it with a
very fine instrument and small hammer3 this hole is then
carefully filed round until its rim become equally sharp
around, so that a very small circle may appear wherever it
may be struck. This instrument slightly warmed afterwards,
so that it scarcely glows, is tempered in water. Then hold
this iron in the left hand and the small hammer· in the right,
and let the boy sit before you, who can hold the plate upon
the anvil and adjust it in the places in which you are about
to strike, and thus fill up a ground with very fine circles as
closely as you can join one to another, gently striking upon
the iron with the small hammer⁴ All the grounds being
filled in, in this manner, place the plate itself upon the hot
embers, until these beatings take a yellow colour.
