xxviii PREFACE.

the treatise abruptly closed with one chapter on the
construction of the organ. The description of this
instrument is now rendered complete ¹ as it existed in
the time of our author. An important description of
the manner of founding bells follows. The next, ‘⁶ Of
. Musical Cymbals,’' tends to show the antiquity of the
author. Our monk treats of the more humble vessels,
made of tin ; of iron, with a description of the apparatus
employed in Damascus work upon steel. Then follows
a description of the Italian work promised in the pre-
face to the whole work, of sculpturing, gilding and
staining ivory; of gems, pearls and electra. It should
be remarked here that Theophilus quotes Eraclius, a
strong argument against his Italian origin. The monk
would here appear to have travelled, note-book in hand,
to collect the various arts from different countries.
The passage in the preface to the Second Book, which
I have preferred to translate literally, rather than to
take in the allegorical sense, in which it has been
hitherto received, and which the character and writings
“ of Theophilus do not warrant, affords strong presump-¹
tion that Theophilus was no Greek monk, which his
description of the “fistula,” the reed or pipe formerly
used by the Roman Church in the celebration of the
sacrament, confirms: “ apprehendi atrium Ayice,” or “Re-
θέα] Sophice, conspicorque cellulam diversorum coleram
omnimoda varietate refertam et monstrantem sinqu-
Zoram utilitatem ac naturam. Quo moa’ inobservate pede
inqressus, replevi armariolum cordis mei sufficienter ea·
omnibus, «ᾖε-ἠ’ The phrase “inobservato pede,’' points
