the copper being directed to be used with sal ammoniae and wine
lees, by Dionisius¹, and with lime and vinegar by Petrus de St·.
Audemar2, thus procuring a verditer.

Geber³, in his notice of silver‚ tells us that, “exposed to the
contact of aeid vapours and of sal ammoniae, it takes a beautiful
violet colour.” Any colour, however, procured from silver‚ on
account of its liability to suffer from hydro-sulphurous vapours,
would be very little permanent. Pure silver, however, will not
take this colour under such circumstances.

Lmnus, c. 16. In the Synonyma Magistri Johannis de Gar-
landia, written in the eleventh century, the word Limbus is de-
scribed as meaning the ornament upon the border of a garment.
In C. 60. L. 3, Theophilus directs that the names of the Apostles
be inscribed on the limbos or borders surmounting the figures
-—“ Quorum nomina scribes in limbo.” The Greek artists wrote
the name of the personage represented either on the nimbus or
glory, or on the limbus surrounding it, as the Greeks were for-
bidden to reverence unknown images.

MAmsc, c. 14. ln the table of synonimes “ Menesch,'' is stated
to be a red colour darker than minium and lighter than sinoper3
the hue of indigo is likewise attributed to it. The juice from the
berries of the elder was also called “ Menesch,'’ ‘⁴ Succus est color
trahens ad indicum. Alii dicunt esse rubeum, minus clarum quam
minium et magis clarum quam sinopis; et aliter vocatur menesch
quod aliter dicitur ipse menesch esse succus sambuci.'’ Idem. Theo-
philus calls the drapery made with ‘⁶ succus folii ” “Violaticum.”

The word Menesch is Greek, the Romaic “ Μενεξές” signifying
‘⁴ violet colour ; '’ from this word probably the Turkish “ mene-
wiche,‘’ purple colour, has arisen. That a violet colour would
coincide with the directions for the use of manisc by Theophilus
is evident, for it is used mixed either with folium, or a little black
and red, as a ground for a drapery, manisc and lazur, and, lastly‚
pure lazur being used to lighten it. It is likewise used in con-
junction with orpiment as a ground, upon which more orpiment is
used as a middle tint and pure orpiment as a high light; the violet
colom· would most effectually neutralize the pure yellow of the
