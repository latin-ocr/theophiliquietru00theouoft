Eraclius, the next author upon this theme, probably of the ninth
or early in the tenth century, speaks of linseed oil, and of its use
with colours, in a more decided manner, in the MS. of John Le
Begue, in the treatise entitled “ Liber tertius et prosaicus Eraclii
antedicti, de coloribus et artibus praedictis.'’

The Le Begue collection from Eraclius‚ however, contains
many chapters which are wanting in the Cambridge MS„ which
only gives one chapter not to be found in the Paris MS„ “De
plumbacione auri vel Argenti.” p 24. These chapters have all the
proofs of authenticity, and are the source from which many of the
early MS. writers have drawn.

“ De oleo, quomodo aptatur ad distemperandum colores.’' ‘⁴ Cal-
cem in oleo mensurate pone, et illud despumando, coque3 cero-
sium in eo secundum quod de oleo fuerit pone, et ad solem per
mensem vel amplius frequenter removendo pone; scito quod
quanto diutius ad solem fuerit tanto melius erit. Postea cola et
serva, et colores inde distempera.’' ’

“Put lime into oil by degrees and boil it, skimming it; put
ceruse into it according to the quantity of oil, and place it in the
sun for a month or more, frequently stirring it,· know that the
longer it has been in the sun, so much better it will be. After-
wards strain it and keep it, and distemper colours with it.'’

This is a very curious as well as valuable passage. It is not
only a proof of the attainment of a great perfectiori in the art of
painting “ oil ” as a material for tempering colours in painting‚ but
it is almost as good a formula for the preparation of a drying oil as
could at this day be given. A patent has lately been taken out for
treating oil with fresh slacked lime during the process of preparing
a drying oil with the per-oxide of lead3 we here find the same
means employed during the ninth or tenth century, probably long
before that time, for it was impossible that the Greeks could have
overlooked the action of the metallic oxides of lead or zinc upon
oil of linseed: the “plumbum combustum et oleum,’' “ massicot, or
minium and oil‚’' of Cornelius Celsus and the other Roman
writers on medicine, produced effects which could not have been
overlooked. Marcellus, who wrote under the empire of Marcus
