smooth piece of wood, and, opening it in that part in which is
the division, you will dilate and smooth it according to your
will with the pincers. When it 1135 become quite smooth,
immediately taking it out, place it in the cooling oven,
moderately warmed3 and so that the plate may not lie down,
but stand against the wall, next to which you will place
another, also flattened iu the same manner, and a third ; also

CHAPTER X.

How VASES ΑΒΕ ΜΑΒΕ FROM GLASS.

IN order to make vases, compose the glass in the furnace in
the above manner, and when you have blown according to
the quantity you wish, you must not make an opening at the
end, as before, but you will detach it from the tube, entire as
it is, with the wood moistened with water ; then make the
tube, warmed, adhere to the bottom itself. Raising the vase,
warm it in the flame, and you will dilate that opening,
whence you separated the tube, with the round piece of
wood, according to your desire3 you will also enlarge the
bottom around the tube so that the lower part may be hollow.
But if you wish to make handles to it, by which it may hang,
take a thin piece of iron, and, immersing it in the pot of glass,
when a little has stuck to it, raising it, place it upon the vase,
in whatever place it may please you3 and when it has adhered,
heat it, so that it may fasten firmly. Make of these handles
what you please, in the mean time keeping the vase near the
flame, so that it may be hot, yet not liquefy. Take also a
little glass from the furnace, so that it may draw a thread
after it, and placing it upon the vase in what place you wish,
revolve it near the flame, that it may adhere. Which being
done, you will remove the tube according to custom, placing
the vase in the cooling oven; and you will work in this

fashion as much as you desire.
