again coals‚) and the stone anew; and it is thus arranged
until it is sufficient for the size of the furnace. And when the
stone has commenced to liquefy, the lead flows out through
some small cavities, and the copper remains within. When
this has been blown upon for a very long time, and cooled, it
is taken out and other is again placed in after the same order.
To this copper thus melted a fifth part of tin is added, and a
metal is made with which bells are founded.

A kind of stone is also found of a yellowish colour‚ and
sometimes red, which is called calamine, which is not broken
up, (¹ but as it is dug up it is placed upon wood, heaped up
and very glowing‚ and is burned until it quite glows. This
stone, afterwards cooled and broken very small‚) is mixed with
coals finely divided, and is mingled with the above-mentioned
copper in the fumace, which is composed in this manner.

CHAPTER LXIV.

*OF THE FURNACE.

Fonn stones‚ in the fashion of a cross, stand, separated
from each other the length of a foot, partly fixed in the
earth, but rising equally to the height of a foot above the
ground, and all equal at the upper part. Upon these stones
four square irons are placed, of the thickness of a finger, and
of a length that they can be laid across from one stone to
another. Between these, other intervening irons are placed
of the same size, at an equal distance, that is, separated from
each other by a breadth of four fingers: upon these also
others, equal in form and measure to those below, are placed
across, so that the openings may appear to be square. These
being thus separated, clay, strongly beaten and mixed with
horse dung, is placed upon the same imus, to the thickness
of three fingers‚ so that it may adhere to these irons and
stones everywhere, and appear as if a round hearth lay upon
the stones. Then with a round wood openings are made in
