Geber directs a mixture of 1 rb of vitriol of Cyprus, l} 1³0 of
saltpetre, and a quarter of alum of J ameni, to be submitted to dis-
tillation in order to procure a liquid of great solvent powerl. He
adds that if you supply a quarter of sal ammoniae to this it will
dissolve gold2. The vitriol of Cyprus is a sulphate of copper; the
nitrate of potash and muriate of ammonia (sal ammoniae) reacting
upon each other form the “aqua regia,’' or mixture of nitrio and
hydrochloric acid, the sulphuric aeid combining with the salifiable
bases.

In c. xxxiii. Theophilus directs that the uric salts and common
salt be mixed with clay for the purpose of purifying gold.

In weight the nummus was sometimes the fourth part of the
silver denarius; sometimes it is placed for the drachma, or {th of

a Roman ounce.

Athos, describes the manner of representing this emblem, so fre-
quently found in the decorations of both Greek and Roman
churches3 but the mode of expressing the benediction differed
with the sects. ι .

“ When you would represent the hand giving benediction do
not join three fingers together, but cross the thumb with the fourth
finger, so that the second, called the index, remaining straight,
and the third being a little bent, they form together the name of
