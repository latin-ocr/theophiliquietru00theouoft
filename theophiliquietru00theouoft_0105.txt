TRANSLATION. 35

If, however, you wish to hasten your work, take gum which
exudes from the cherry or plum tree, and »cutting it up very
small, place it in an earthenware pot, and pour water upon it
abundantly, and place it in the sun, or in winter upon the
coals, until the gum has liquefied ; and mix it together with a
smooth piece of wood. Then strain it through a cloth, and
grind the colours with it and lay them on. All colours and
their mixtures can be ground and laid on with this kind of oil,
except minium and ceruse and carmine, which are ground and
laid on with white of egg. Spanish green is not mixed with
succus under the gluten, but is laid on by itself with gum
gluten. You can otherwise mix it, if you wish it.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
How oFTEN THE SAME conones MAY BE LAID ON.

YOU should apply all colours three times upon wood, whether
ground in oil or in gum ; and the picture finished and dried and
the work carried into the sun, carefully cover it with varnish
gluten, and when it begins to flow from the heat, lightly rub
it with the hand, and do this three times, and then leave it

until it is quite dry.

A PIOTURE is likewise made ‚upon wood, which picture is X

called transparent, and after some it is called aureola, which
you compose in this manner. Take tin leaf, not covered with
varnish nor coloured with saffron, but simply as it is, and
iligently polished, and with it you cover the place on which
ou wish thus to paint. Then grind the colours to be laid on

most carefully with linseed oil, and when very fine, lay theinn-
