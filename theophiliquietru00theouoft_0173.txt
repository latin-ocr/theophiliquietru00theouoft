portraits of great men, but was employed for various other pur-
poses, particularly for ornamenting apartments, furniture, and
shields, &c.‚ of persons of rank and fortune.

As this chapter immediately follows the mention of colours
ground in oil, and the composition of an oil varnish, it is more
than probable that, considering also the nature of the work, these
saddles, &c., were painted in oil colours, and, as directed, after-
wards varnished.

In the reign of Henry II., (1154-1189,) Henry de Blois,
archdeacon of Rath, and chaplain to the king, exclaims against
the luxury indulged in by the military men of his time, and
censures the ostentation of some of these barons: “They carry
shields into the field so richly gilded‚ that they present the pros-
pect of booty rather than of danger to the enemy, and they bring
them back untouched, and, as I may say, in a virgin state. They
also cause both their shields and saddles to be painted with the
representations of battles and equestrian combats, that they may
please their imaginations with the contemplation of scenes in
which they do not choose to engage.” ¹

Smoms, c. 1. Theophrastus tells us that Σινοπικῆν or Sinopic earth
was dug in Cappadocia, but carried to Sinope for sale; also, “that
there were three kinds of the Sinopic: one of a deep red colour;
another pale; the third of a middle colour between the two, which
was called the pure and simple kind, because it was used without
mixing, whereas they mix the others.”2 He adds, “there is also
a kind of sinoper made from ochre‚ by burning, the invention of
Cidias, who observed that some ochre, in a house on fire, when
half burnt assumed a red colour.’' ³ Sinopis thus became a gene-
ral name for all the red ochreous earths or reddles, the “ miltes ”
of the Greeks, and “ rubrica '⁹ of the Romans.

The Μιλτος of Theophrastus is certainly no other than the red
ochreous earth or ore which owes its colour to iron. He gives
the different varieties of miltos, and tells us that “ the best came

q from Cea 4, particularly that which was taken from the reddle pits;
