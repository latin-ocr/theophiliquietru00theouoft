162 NOTES To Boox 11.

The sand of the Belus was probably found purer than else-
where, and fit for the composition of fine glass‚ and thus the
Phoenicians first became the producers of a beautiful and cele-
brated white glass, the most difficult of all, at this period, to
acquire. For, owing to the presence of metallic oxides in the
alkaline carbonate, or the quartzous fragments, the production of
a coloured glass would be of earlier date than a pure and colour-
less vitrification. Theophilus provides for the casual colouring

of the “metal” through the mixture of metallic oxides with its
elements.

The divers colours of glass not 'transparenn which Theophilus
tells us, c. xii„ were found in the edifices of the Pagans, in mosaic
work, were doubtless of the kind which were seen in Egypt by
M. de Roziere, and the art of making which was transmitted to
the Greeks. Pliny¹ remarks upon a manufacture imitating the ob-
sidian stone, “ Obsidian stone is also made in stained fashion, for
vessels of repast, and a perfectly red glass and not Nor TRANS-
LUCENT, called liaematinon. Wffl'rE is also made and MURRHINUM
(purple), or HYAcm'rn and SAPPHIRE, and imitation in Am„
OTnER COLouRs.’' In the previous chapter Pliny mentions that
pavements and other ornaments in glass were used by Agrippa in
the construction of his baths. This kind of mosaic work, then,
served the Byzantine artists in the construction of the enamelled
vases which were so beautiful in colour and are now so rare.
These enamels are all opaque, and present the appearance of the
'finest mosaics. Theophilus tells us that white, black, green,
yellow‚ blue, red and purple glass, found also in the form of
utensils‚ were used for this work by the French, who were al-
ready “ skilful in the art ’' of working glass. Pliny, indeed,
states that Italy, Gaul, and Spain, pursued the manufacture of
glass.

This opaque glass was, doubtless, the Vl'rmm Romnum of

Eraclius, some of whose chapters are quoted by Theophilus at the
end of the third book.
