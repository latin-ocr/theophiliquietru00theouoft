TRANSLATION. 243

with it until it is as thick as lees3 with a thin picce of wood
you anoint about the nails insidc and outside, and you
rub off with a small iron the filed silver over it, and you
will thus dry it. Again paint this mixture over it more
thickly than before, and put it into the fire, and coals being
applied, carefully cover it, and you will blow gently with a
long breath until the soldering is sufficiently melted; with-
drawing the Vase from the fire, and cooling it slightly, you
will wash it, and, if the nails are firm, it is well ;' but if not,
do again to them as before. And when they have become
firm, file them off inside and serape them smoothly, that no
one may be able to see in what place they have stood, and
the handles being set on outside, again carefully join them on.
Then make through the middle of the handles against the
nails very fine hollows‚ and likewise in the same place beyond
the nails, into which you fix them with all perfected labour,
so that no one may perceive how they adhere. After these
things sculpture and grave these handles studiously with files
and iron instruments, and if you wish to blacken anything in
them, act in this manner.

CHAPTER XXXII.

ALSO OF LAYING ΟΝ THE NIELLO.

WHEN you have mixed and melted the niello, take a portion
of it and beat it square, long and slender. T hen take the
handle with the pincers and heat it in the fire until it glows,
and with another forceps, long and thin, hold the niello and
rub it over all the places which you wish to make black until
all the drawings are full, and carrying it away from the fire
carefully make it smooth with a flat file until the silver ap-
pear, so that you can scarcely observe the traits, and so
serape it with the cutting iron, carefully cut away the ine-
qualities, and you will gild what remains. Which gilding you
compose in this manner.
