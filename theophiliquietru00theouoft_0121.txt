out of this pan put it into one smaller‚ and cook it until it
grows black and begins to thicken‚ quite taking care that you
add no water, except that which is mixed with the sap. And
when you see it thicken, add one third part of pure wine, and
putting it into two or three new pots, cook it until you see a
sort of skin show itself on the surface. Then taking these
pots from the fire, place them in the sun until the black
ink purifies itself from the red dregs. Afterwards take small
bags of parchment carefully sewu, and bladders, and pouring
in the pure ink, suspend them in the sun until all is quite dry.
And when dry, take from it as much as you wish and temper
it with wine over the fire, and, adding a little vitriol, write.
But if it should happen through negligence that your ink be
not blaek enough, take a fragment¹ of the thickness of a
finger, and putting it into the fire allow it to glow, and throw
it directly into the i-nk.
