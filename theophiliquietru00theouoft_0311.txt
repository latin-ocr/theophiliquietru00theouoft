length, but let it be somewhat thicker at the top; this wax is
called the funnel, and which you will make fast with a hot
iron. Then take clay well beaten, and cover carefully both
the handles one by oue, so that all the hollows of the sculpture
may be filled up. When these are dry again cover equally
over all, except the top of the funnel, and do thus a third
time. Afterwards place these moulds near the coals, that
when they have become warm you may pour out the wax.
Which being turned out, place them altogether in the fire,
turning the openings through which the wax flowed out
downwards, and leave them until they glow like the coals, and
immediately melt the silver, adding to it a little Spanish

through the vase through the two holes, on both sides above
and below, and fasten them inside, and solder in this manner.
