“It had a small cup to receive the precious liquid which might
fall through accident, from which, in such case, it would fall back
into the chalice by two small tubes. The instrument was some-
times fixed to the chalice.”

The reed was unknown to the Greeks.

“ They break many small pieces of the consecrated bread, which
they place in the chalice. They have a small spoon with which
the priest takes one of these small pieces dipped in the wine, and he
thus gives it to the communicants. It is only to the priests and
clerks assisting at the Liturgy that they give the chalice. The
Greeks assert that St. John Chrysostome established the use of
this spoon, but there is no certain proof amongst the ecclesiastical
writers. According to the legend it was thus, that about the year
400, a solitary saint of Egypt received a miraculous Eucharist
which was brought to him by angels.

“ The spoon was consecrated as well as the chalice and patena.
This instrument, unknown to the Latins, as was the reed to the
Greeks, is not mentioned by Theophilus, who has in view only the
pomps of the Western Church.’'

C. XLVIII. DE AURO HISPANICO·

When the smile, excited by the language of those who followed
the sacred science‚ “ ἔπιστῆμη ιερα,” or chemistry, shall have
passed, we shall probably be anxious to search into the meaning
of our author.

The Egyptians, according to all authorities, practised the science
at a remote period, and it was in their schools that the Greeks and
Arabs were initiated into the sacred science, the revelation of the
mysteries of which was, at one time, punished by death.

Theophilus, who informs us that “the skilfulness of the Gentiles
in this art is probable,” is doubtless alluding to the Arab alche—
mists of Spain, who at an early period pursued the sciences ac-
quired from the Greeks and Egyptians.

The process which Theophilus describes in this symbolic lan-
guage, appears no other than that for procuring a pure gold by the
means of the mineral acids. Let a solution of gold be made by
nitro-muriatic aeid and copper be introduced, the latter would be
dissolved while the gold would re-appear‚ but in a state of purity,
or, as the alchemists would have expressed it, the copper would
