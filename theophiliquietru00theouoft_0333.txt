rise above the flat part of the whole patena3 you sculp this
finely and cover it with nieHo, and you will gild the rest of
the patena, and you polish it on both sides as above.

CHAPTER XLV.

OF THE PIPE.

YoU make also the pipe for the chalice in this manner. Make
’ an iron in length a palm and four fingers, which at one end
must be very fine and must continue increasing to the other
extremity, which must be like a. straw3 and let the iron be
round and smoothly filed. And when you have thinned some
pure silver, sold it round this iron, joining the ends smoothly
with a file, and taking off the iron, place it in the fire, and
solder it. Again placing the iron in it, beat it with the
hammer equally over all until the join is no longer visible.
· Then make, by itself, a knob round and hollow, or square and
solid, and make a perforation in it, through which the pipe is
placed from the lower part almost to the top, and thus, the
iron being taken away, you will again solder everywhere.
And when it has become firm, the iron being put on anew, you
beat everywhere from the knob downwards until it is made
smooth and firm 3 and from the knob upwards, namely, in
that part which is wider and thicker, place on an iron, thin
and wide, according to the size of the pipe, and beat it with
the hammer upon an anvil, so that the upper opening may be
square and thin‚ which from the knob upwards should sur-
mount the chalice and be held in the mouth, but be below
round and slender. Which being done, if you wish‚ you can
ornament the knob with niello, and you will gild the rest of
the pipe in the fashion above„ Take great care in this, that
you strongly scrape all thick silver which you wish to gild,
whether for a cup, or plate, or bottle, because in working
it forms a pellicle outside, from the fire and hammer,
which, if not scraped away when it is gilt, when it is coloured
