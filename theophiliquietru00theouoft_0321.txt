and again put in sand with water. When from the rotation
and re-rotation the sand has begun to bubble and be diffused
over the stone, collect it again always, and replace it in the
hollow with a small, long, and thin wood, unless by chance
the gold should be scattered and not milled. But when it is
completely ground it is taken out and washed and dried as
above, and it is placed upon a scale. If, however, any should
be deficient, the dregs which flow from the stone are
washed, and it is thus found 3 for this reason it is that the
stone is placed in the vase. In this manner also should pure
silver, very thinly beaten, and mixed with quicksilver, be
milled, because it cannot be milled in the hot vessel with a
heated iron. It should be so mixed together, however, that
five parts, by weight, may be of quicksilver, and the sixth be
pure silver.

You can also grind gold lighter in this manner. Take a large
vase of clay proved in the fire, and place it in the coals until
it quite glows3 and put into it the gold mixed with the quick—
silver and broken up very small, and holding it with the pin-
cerS‚ move round the hand evenly‚ and you will soon see how
the gold is liquefied and mixed with the quicksilver. And
when it has become quite liquid, directly pour it into water,
and wash and dry it as above. Beware above all of this, that
you do not grind, or gild, fasting‚ because the exhalation of
quicksilver is of great danger to a fasting stomach, and it
generates different infirmities, against which you should use
Zedoar and the berries of the laurel, with pepper and garlick
and wine. After this, weigh this gilding substance in the
balance and divide it in two, and the half of it again into
two, and until you obtain single drams, and put them singly
into goose-quills‚ that you may know how much you may lay
on in gilding in every place. Then beat a portion of red
copper into the shape of a chisel, and fix it to a handle, and
