CHAPTER XCIV.

OF POLISHING GEMS.

CRYSTAL, which is water hardened into ice, and the ice of great
age is hardened into stone, is trimmed and polished in this
manner. Take the composition which is called tenax, of
which mention is made above, and applying it to the fire
until it liquefy, you will fasten the crystal to a long. wood,
which must be similar to it in thickness. When this has be-
come cold, you will rub it with both hands upon a hard sand-
stone, water being added, until it takes the form which γοα
wish to give it, then upon another stone of the same kind,
which must be finer and smoother, until it be made quite
smootli. And taking a flat leaden tablet, place moistened
tile upon it, which you will rub with saliva upon a hard hone,
and you polish this crystal upon it until it takes a lustrc.
But at last, place the rubbing of tile, made moist with saliva,
upon a goat's skin, neither blackened nor oiled, but stretched
upon wood and fixed below with nails, and rub carefully upon
it, until it becomes quite bright. But should you wish to
sculp crystal‚ taking a goat of the age of two or three years
and binding his feet, cut an opening between his breast and
stomach, in the position of the heart, and lay in the crystal,
so that it may lie in its blood until it grow warm. Taking it
out directly, cut what you please in it, as long as the heat
lastS, and when it has begun to grow cold and to harden‚ re-
place it again in the blood of the goat, and being made warni
anew, take it out and cut it, and do thus until you complete
the sculptur3e at the last, being made warm and taken out,

you will rub it with a linen cloth so that with the same blood
you can procure a lustie for it. Should you, however, wish to
make knobs from crystal, which can be placed upon the
staves of bishops‚ or the tips of the stem, you will perforate
them in this manner3 make two hammers for yourself, of
the thickness of the little finger, and almost a palm in length,
and at each end very pointed and well steeled. And when

you have formed the knob, cut a hole in a wood, so that it
