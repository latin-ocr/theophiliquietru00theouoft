Dutens states that during the excavations at Pompeii in 1778,
the windows of some chambers‚ attached to the baths‚ were found
glazed with as fine glass as that of the moderns. Lactantius¹ and
St. Jerome ², writers of the third and fourth centurieS, both speak
of glazed windows. The employment of coloured glass arranged
in Mosaic fashion, the “fenestra simplex,'’ c. 29 of Theophilus,
would soon give place to the use of painted glass as the art ad-
vanced. Observant of the effects of colour productive of such
admiration during the early efforts of art, new exerfions, in order
to unite the beauty of pictorial effect with the previous richness of
decoration, would doubtless soon be made to call to aid the talents
of the Christian artist.

In the sixth century, when Fortunatus of Poitiers ³ lauds the

- bishops who ornamented their churches with large windows of

glaSS, and the effect which they produced by the rays of the sun3
he, by this, evidently intends a coloured glass.

Sidonius Apollinaris4, in his letter to Hesperius, speaks positively
of coloured glass having been used in the windows of the church
erected by Patiens, at Lyons.

“ Ecclesia nuper constructa est Lugduni, quae studio papae Pa-
tientis ad summum coepti operis accessit, viri sancti, strenui, &c-

“ Intus lux micat, atque bracteatum
Sol sic sollicitatur ad lacunar,
Fulvo ut concolor erret in metallo,
Distinctum vario nitore marmor
Percurrit cameram, solum, fenestras.
Ac sub versicoloribus figuris
Vel-nans herbida crusta saphiratos
Flectit per prasinum vitrum lapillos.''

Fortunatus and Paul the hermit, as well as Theophilus, de-
scribe the admirable effect which the rising· sun produced through
the windows of St. Sophia at Constantinople. <See Preface to this
Book, p. 117.)

It is more than probable that all these early ornamental windows
were in the Mosaic style of art, and that the various glass was
coloured by the combination of the metallic oxides with the glass
