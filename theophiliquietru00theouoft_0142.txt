Edward ΙΙΙ.. destroyed this chapel, and, in rebuilding it with
increased magnificence, pressed all the painters for this work in
Kent, Bliddlesex, Essex. Surrey and Sussex3 also, by another edict,
those in the counties of Lincoln‚ Northampton‚ Oxford, Warwick‚
Leicester, Cambridge, Huntingdon‚ Norfolk and Suffolk¹.

Among the items of expenses in the Exchequer Rolls for this
work, are—

“ Four fiaggons of painter’s oil for painting the chapel, 16s.
Half a pound of Tynct. for the same.

Six pounds and a half of white varnish from ‘ Lomyn de

Bruges,’ at 9d. per pound, for painting of the said chapel.”

In an old English Monkish MS. of the fourteenth century,
(Sloane 2584) in a collection of recipes for painting and the mate-
rials required, a curious varnish is given.

“Take of Terbentyne llb.,ofgume Arabyk ltb„ offrank ensence
lrb„ and melt them togeder‚ and put there to oyle of Lynsed als a
mochel as it nedes ε and thus you schalt assay zif it be wele
molten to geder. Take a drope or 2 of clere water and sprinkle
therein, and then take a litel there of be twene your fingers and
zif it is helding togeder, als wer gumed, it is goode, and zif it is
nost so put yet more oyle.''

Arabio resin, or Sandanac, has been called “ Gum Arabio ’³
indiscriminately with the gum of the Mimosa Nilotica, even as late
as the middle of the last century. This has led to strange mis-
takes. The author of “ Institutes of Experimental Chemistry,'’
who should have therefore known better, comments upon the sin-
gularity of thefact, that ⁴⁴ Gum Arabick” is soluble in fixed oil,
and states that it yields an oil by distillation ².

, That the “ vernice liquida '' of the Italians during the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries was identical with the varnish of Theophi-
lus we have proofamongst their writers. Cardanus, who flourished
at the commencement of the sixteenth century, and who therefore
possessed the experience of the fifteenth, tells us that “liquida
vernix '’ is made from linseed oil and vernix of the cedar juniper
species.—De Plautis, Lib. 8.

“ Vernix ex cedro J uniperi species.”

“ Ob id ignitur e ‘ sicca vernice,' et lini oleo fit liquida vernix,
