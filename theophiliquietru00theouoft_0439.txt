CHAPTER LXXXVI.

ΟΡ ΤΗΕ MEASURE OF GYMBALS.

WHOEVER wishes to make cymbals of proper sound for sing-
ing, -should divide the wax for each one with a weight‚ and
should begin from the highest, that by descending he may be
able to arrive at the graver (cymbals). He can likewise note
each one with its own letter, that he may know it in the par-
tition. In the first place let him make two portions of wax
equal with the balance, one for letter a, the other for G. Let
him divide the wax of letter a into eight equal partS, and
(give) so much to the wax of letter G as is in the eighth part
of wax a .· let him similarly divide wax G by eight, and give
so much to letter F as is in its total, and an eighth of its part
beyond, and he will have two consecutive notes. In that
place the semitone should be, and let him thus find it. Let
him divide the whole of the wax of letter a into three parts,
and give this total to letter E and beyond, the third part of it.
Then let him give so much wax to letter D as is in the total a,
and the eighth part of it. Likewise let him give as much
wax to letter c as G possesses and half a part of it, and he will
thus have two notes after the semitone. Then let him afford
to letter Β so much wax as is in the whole amount of letter F
and beyond, the third part of it, and he will have the semi-
tone again ; and let· him find the seven concords from letter
a to Β. The octave he cannot yet have without the eighth
cymbal. Let him therefore double all the wax of letter a,
and so give it to letter A, and nothing will be wanting: the
fourth, eighth and fifth chord let him find thus, let him take
the amount of the wax of the letter and give so much to
letter F and the half of it beyond, and let him establish it
between A and Β. He who should fashion or found the
cymbals should above all take care, that he puts none of
the above mentioned wax, which is so cautiously weighed
and divided, to the necks and air· -,holes but let him make

all these from other wax, Let him have the great fore-
