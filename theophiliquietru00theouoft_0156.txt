placed at the end of the first book, which shows that the Greeks
at this hour follow the process of the twelfth century, and which,
although not “ true fresco” as at present understood, is a transi-
tion from the mural practice of Theophilus, and probably the
“ recens murus,'' to the “ fresco buono,'' and perhaps a better style
for interiors than either, as offering the same facility to the artist

as the former and being as durable as the latter style. See the
ideas of Guevara¹ upon this subject.

“ emm: FOR PAmtrmo υΡοΝ WALLS.

‘⁶ When you would paint upon walls, choose good lime3 let it be
as fat as lard, and it must not contain uncalcined stones. If it is
poor and filled with this kind of stones‚ make a trough of wood,
dig a hole of the necessary size, place the lime in the trough‚
and add water, which you will carefully stir with a stick until the
lime appears well steeped. Pour this lime into a basket‚ placed
over the hole, and which will arrest the stones. Then the milk of

lime thus obtained must be left quiet, until it has coagulated and is
capable of being taken up by the trowel.”

“ now THE LIME 1s MIXED wrm STRAW.

“ T ake the purified lime and place it in a large trough, choose
straw‚ fineand without dust3 mix it with the lime, stirring it with
a pick. If the lime is too thick, add water, to succeed in employing
it easily for working. Allow these to ferment two or three days,
and you can then lay the plaster (‘ arriciat0.')”

“ How Tm: LIME ιε ΜΙΧΕΒ wrm 'row-

“ Take the best lime you have prepared, place it in a small
trough. Take tow, well cleaned from all bark and well crushed 3
twist it, as if to make a cord, and, by the aid of a hatchet, cut it
into as small particles as you can3 shake it well, to separate the
din, and throw it into the trough‚ where you will mix it care-
fully by the aid of a trowel or pick. You will take care to try it,
and recommence, (working it ἲ) until the lime does not crack upon
the wall. Allow it to ferment like the other, and you will thus have
lime prepared with tow to form the superficial plaster, (‘ intonaco.')”
