it is therefore “sinoper‚” not “vermilion,” which is intended,
and which latter is given in our translation. Jememiah, c. xxii.,
v. 14, “ It is ceiled with cedar, and painted with “vermilion;” it
should be rendered “sinoper.”

Some of the varieties of haematite outwardly resemble mineral
cinnabar: hence another source of error, which the observant have
been careful to point out.

Our own country produces as fine varieties of sinoper as any.
Hill states¹, that the reddle sometimes sold in London, under the
name of Indian red, was much the finest he had ever seen, and
was from among the iron ore in the forest of Dean‚ and not from
a reddle pit: it was not inferior to that of Ormuz in the Persian
Gulf, so much valued as Indian red.

Ῑ hope to have an opportunity of showing, in a work now in
progress, that this English colour has been much appreciated, and
was famous during the best periods of the art in the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries.

De Boot thus notices this variety²z “Haematitis a sanguine
nornen habet, Germanice ‘Bluet-stein ’ vocatur. Quanquam in-
terdum niger, interdum flavus, interdum ferri colorem habeat.
Strias antimonii instar habet. Dum uritur, minii colorem imi-
tatur. Habet cinnabari similem colorem.’'

Theophrastus describes the Haematite ³, as “ dense, solid, dry,
or, according to its name, seeming as if formed of concreted
blood 3 ” he adds, “ there is also another kind of it called xanthus,
which is not of the colour of the former, but of a yellowish white,
which colour the Dorians call xanthus.’'

As the yellow ochres are “hydrates of iron‚”so are the red
ochres “oxides of iron,” and in proportion to the quantity of
oxygen contained in the substance the deeper does the colour
become. The trit-oxide, or purple oxide, is the highest point of
oxidation. The greater proportion of clay which the yellow or
red ochres possess, the brighter will be the colour. Our sinoper
is a compact heavy substance of a deep red colour, soiling the
fingers when handled, and answering to our Indian red.
