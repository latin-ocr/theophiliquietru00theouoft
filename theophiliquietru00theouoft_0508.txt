The difference between “aes ’⁹ and ‘⁶ aurichalcum‚” both a brass‚
is taught us by Theophilus, · “aes” is the mixture of calamiae with
unrefined copper—‘⁴ aurichalcum'' is made with very pure copper,
because it can then be gilt. C. 66.

Theophilus speaks of Spanish brass, as used in 111111 plates 111
stamped work. This, being gilt‚ is probably a thin plate of copper
coated with gold by the process described in note to C. 48, p.

C. LXXII. INTERRASILIS OPUS.

Critics have differed as to the interpretation of this word.
⁴‘ Quod nunc seripturis nunc planitie variatur 3 hoc, et non aliud,
opus, interrasile dicas.'’——-Alex. By this would be intended an
engraved work, varied with plain surfaces. It 1135 been called
“Anaglypha Scriptura‚'' carved work. Muratori thought that it
applied only to the species of engraving in the manner of seals.
“ Quo nomine opinor, non omnem caelaturam designari, sed eam
tantum, quae incidendo figuras efformabat, ut est in sigillis.” (V.
2, p. 360.) Theophilus, in designating this as Arabian work, 1135
caused Emeric David ¹ and M. de l’Escalopier2 to think that the
word interrasilis means Damascus work, “ damasquinure,'' or the
threaded gold or silver work seen upon the sabres, pistols, cui-
rasses, &c., of the east. We fortunately possess a chapter in this
MS. in which this latter art is carefully detailed; the damascine
work is described in one of the chapters hitherto unknown, C. 90.

⁴ The opus interrasilis, then, is an engraved or sculptured plate,
the plain grounds of which are cut out with the chisel, or “meizel,”
in the German. Our ancient English brasses are of this nature.

C. LXXV. OF STAMPED WORK.

This branch of industry has already been followed in France
since the publication of Theophilus by the Count de l’Escalopier
in 1843. 1 have seen some bold and handsome designs from
Paris, executed in thin gilt copper, in this fashion, well calculated
