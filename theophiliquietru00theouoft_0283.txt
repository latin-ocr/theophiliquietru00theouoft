may be stripped off whole, and being filled with straw‚ they
are moderately dried. Afterwards they are thrown into a
preparation of lye and salt for a day and two nights‚ the
third day they are stretched lengthwise, but more in breadth.
Then they are anointed and again stretched. After this the
wooden head to the bellows is made, which passes through
its neck and is there bound, and in this head a perforation
through which an iron tube may pass. But behind, in the
width of the bellows‚ four pieces of wood are placed, of which‘
two are joined together and fixed in the middle; and two are
sewed upon the bellows together, so that the joinings in
the middle may be above and below ; where also two loops
of the same skin are sewed on, the one above smaller, in
which the thumb is placed, the other larger below, where the
other four fingers are put. These things finished, place the
iron tube in the hole of the furnace, and fire and charcoal at
the back and front of the furnace, and blow, that the furnace
may become dry. The names of utensils and iron instru-
ments, in work of fusion, are these.

CHAPTER V.

OF ANVILS.

ANvlhs, flat, smooth and square. Also anvils even and
horned. Also anvils round at the top, like half an apple, one
large, another smaller, a third short, which are called knots.
Also anvils long and narrow on> the top, like two horns pro-
ceeding from a spear, of which one may be rounded and
diminishing so that it be pointed at the end, but the other
broader and slightly turned round at the end with round
smoothness, like a thumb. These are made large and

small.
