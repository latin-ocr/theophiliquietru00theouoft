is most powerfully dyed with hysginum and it is thought that the
red endures.'' “ The painters (he continues) lay a ground with red
ochre, then glazing over the purple with egg, they give the splen-
dour of minium.” Pliny here uses sandyx, for burnt ochre, and
minium for red lead. “ Ι f they wish rather to make a purple colour,
they underlay blue‚ then they overlay the purpurissimum with egg.”

Xenophon, Cyr. viii. 3. 7, writes ὑσγινοβᾶφῆς, dyed purple.

Sir H. Davy states¹ that a pale rose colour was found in a vase
in the Baths of Titus, that the colouring matter was vegetable‚
and that it'was mixed with a considerable quantity of . carbonate of
lime, (chalk.) He proceeds, “ It differed from madder, as the
madder lake gave a much deeper tint to muriatic aeid and pro-
duced a tawny hue when its weak muriatic solution was acted on
by muriate of iron. The ancient lake did not change its colour.
The ancient lake agreed with the lake of cochineal in being ren-
dered of a deeper hue by weak alkalies, and of a brighter hue by
weak acids, but it differed from it in being much more easily-de-
stroyed by strong acids. It agreed with both in being immediately
destroyed by a solution of chlorine.'’

Was this colour “ orceine?’' (the colouring matter of the
“ lichen roccella’' and the hysginum of the ancients.) If so, this
vaiuable colour seen by Davy, and which astonished all who saw
it, should not be neglected.

In the Tab. Voc. Syn. we find, “ Purple, which is a red colour,
is otherwise called ‘ folium3 ’ and the English, in whose country it
is grown, call it ‘ wormam.' A purple colour is also made from the
stone, sil, burnt, and extinguished in vinegar while it is glowing.
Oster is a fish, of the sea or elsewhere, from which a purple colour
is made, or from its blood3 and also the sea conchae, when cut,
make a purple colour. And likewise white chalk tinctured with
madder, (rubed radice). So also the herb called vaccinium yields
a purple colour if mixed with lake,'' (cum lacte ².) This leads us
to the consideration of the lake of the ancients.

“ Lacca is a kind of gum made of the red liquor which proceeds
from the juice of the ivy cleaving to and creeping upon trees, if
its branches are perforated with a sharp instrument 'in the month
of March:”³ again,

“ Edera is a plant, creeping, by attaching itself to trees, which in
