fit them to the construction by beating with the hammer, so
that no wind can issue, unless through the openings in
which the pipes are placed. When the wind-case has been
cast and filed, and the pipe of each air—issue fitted to its
conductor, it should be joined together and firmly soldered
below to the organ construction, so that the wind may find
its access freely, and can in nowise issue through the other
joints. This also is to be carefully provided, that a thin piece
of copper may hang down before the opening of its pipe,
which can close the access of the air-bole, so that when by
the breathing of the bellows this copper is displaced‚ it may
rise, and the wind may freely issue3 and when the bellows is
raised, so that it may recover air through its own ventilator,

this copper can quite close its mouth and not permit the
wind which it emitted to return.

CHAPTER LXXXV.

OF FOUNDING BELLS.

IN making a bell, first cut a dry piece of wood, as long as you
wish to have the bell, so that on every side it may protrude
beyond the shape to the length of one palm, and let it be
square at one larger end, at the other more pointed and round,
so that it can be revolved in a hole. And let it be drawn out
larger and larger, so that, when the work has been finished,
it can easily be taken out. This wood must be cut around
in the thicker part, one palm before the end, that a hollow
may be made two fingers wide, and let the wood be there
round3 near this furrow the extremity of the wood is made
thin, that it may be joined in another curved wood, by which
it is able to be revolved like a lathe. Two planks are also
made, equal in length and width, which are joined together
and made firm with four pieces of wood, so that they may be
wide between each other according to the length of the afore-

said wood; a hole should be made in one plank m which the
