gems are divided into male and female ; he instanees the “ cyanus‚’'
of which he is not then treating, as being divided in the same
manner. Hill continues the error of previous commentators,
Philander, De Laet., C. Leonardus, &c.‚ &c., διο.

Theophrastus tells us that the sapphire was spotted‚ as it were, μ
with gold, ‘⁶ χρι·σ6παξος.” Hill denies this to be the lapis lazuli,
following De Boot, who writes, “ Quam gemman Plinius sapphi-
rum vocat, cyanus est, seu lapis lazuli,” a double error, divided
between both the critics.

But Theophrastus says that¹ “ The native cyanus,” (or lapis
armenus) “nemag αὖτοφυὺς” has in it ‘⁴ chrysocolla‚” “ χρυσοκόλλαι,”
which, with the ancients, was a green oxide of copper. Hill here
admits this to mean the lapis armenus, attempting to avoid the
dilemma by making the cyanus before mentioned a “ gem,” for-
getting that there were more than one kind of “cyanus.”

In c. 90, Theophrastus places κύανος, cyanus, and “ chryso-
colla” among colours used by painters.

Hill, having apparently perplexed himself, accuses Pliny of con-

fusion2, and, having embroiled the question, asserts that Pliny has
misunderstood Theophrastus. This is both unlikely and erroneous.
Pliny “De Jaspidum generibus” l. 37. c. 9, describes cyanus,
and after mentioning, as Theophrastus, that the Egyptian kind was
“ tinctured‚'’ proceeds, “ Dividitur autem et hoc in mares foemi-
nasque. Inest ei aliquando et aureus pulvis, non qualis in sapphi-
rinis.” He follows with “ SAppnmus ENm ET AURms PUNCTIS
COLLUCET. “ Ceruleae et sapphiri, raroque cum purpura. Optime
apud Medos, nusquam tamen perlucidae,” &c.‚ certainly a dis-
tinction is made here between the cyanus and the sapphirus.
· The deep blue, “lapis armenus⁵⁹ or cyanus, is even now cut for
ornaments3 some of this so closely resembles sapphirus or lapis
lazuli that it is only by the‘ test of fire, which destroys the blue
colour of the native carbonate of copper, the two are to be distin-
guished. De Boot³³, upon lapis lazuli, gives this true test of the
stone. “ Fixus' lapis lazuli, hoc est, qui igni impositus colorem
non mutat.’'

“ The lapis lazuli is permanent, that which is placed in the
fire does not change colour, this is the legitimate proof3 it is mostly
