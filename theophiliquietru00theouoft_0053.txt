' PREFACE. xxxv

The earliest mention Ι find of distilled linseed oil is
in conjunction with amber varnish3 it is to be used as
a varnish, or glaze‚ upon painted subjects, and it is con-
tained in a collection of recipes relative to the Arts,

less specific gravity‚ and also of a lighter colour than that which
follows, and it forms a stratum upon the darker and denser vola-
tile oil.‘ The darker volatile oil is of the colour of pale amber,
the lighter a very pale straw colour, almost colourless. They
unite by agitation‚ as also will the small quantity of water, if the oil
is not carefully decanted from it.

MEMORANDUM, October 28, 1845.

This distilled or empyreumatic oil should be kept in a jar covered
with rnuslin so as merely to keep out dust and din, but to allow the
entrance of air and the escape of the empyreuma. In a short time
this oil, which is at first so pungent and offensive, becomes gradu-
ally of less powerful odour, and in a few weeks is not of more un-
pleasant smell than boiled linseed oil. It appears to absorb oxy-
gen by contact with air, and at a temperature of 400, F. becomes
flocculent in appearance, while at 70³, F. it remains transparent.
This is not a deposition of stearine‚ but the effect of a diminution
of temperatum, the absence of heat causing it to become solid, as is
the case with many distilled oils, at that temperature.

Amber varnisb, (and probably other thick oil varnishes‚) would
be equally benefited thinned with this distilled oil; it dries with-
out a pellicle when mixed with colours. colours used for finish-
ing a picture, such as in the light for solid painting, or glazing for
colour and shadows, are rendered very pure, and without the
slightest appearance of a skin‚ although it may be plentit'ully used.
It dries much more slowly than any other distilled oil, and hence
its great value‚ as it allows the artist as much time as he requires
in order to blend his colours and finish his work. In conjunction
with amber varnish it forms a vehicle which leaves nothing to be
desired, and which doubtless was the vehicle of Van Eyck, and
in many instances of the Venetian masters, and of Correggio‚ the
different modes of painting necessarily producing the varied appear-
ances of the different schools and masters.
