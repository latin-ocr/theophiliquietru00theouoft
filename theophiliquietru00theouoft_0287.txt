CHAPTER IX.

01³ THE INSTRUMENT WHICH IS CALLED THE ORGANARIUM.

Tumuz is also an iron instrument called the organarium,
which consists of two irons, an under and upper3 but the
lower part has the size and length of the middle finger, and
is somewhat slender, having -two points to which wood is fixed
below, over which, at the upper part, protrude two long nails,
which receive the upper part of the instrument 3 this iron has
the size and length of the one underneath, and has two per-
forations through which the two lower¹ nails may be con-
ducted, that they (the irons) may be joined together. They
should also be well joined together with the file, and in both
of them small grooves should be hollowed out, so that the
holes may appear through the middle, so that when silver or
gold, smoothly beaten long and round, is placed in the larger
(groove)‚ the upper part of the instrument is strongly struck
with the horned hammer, and the gold or silver is turned
round with the other hand, and round beads like beans are
made3 in the next furrow they are made like peas, in the
third like lentils, and so on sinaller.

CHAPTER X.

OF FILES HOLLOWED UNDERNEATH.

SLENDER irons are also made like straws, a finger in length,
rectangular, but on one side wider, the ends of which, upon
which the handles are placed, are curved upwards3 but un-
derneath, lengthwise, a groove is traced, and is filed like a
furrow, and on both sides of it sha'rp ribs are filed. With
these instruments golden and silver wires, thick and fine, are
filed, so that beads may appear upon them.

¹ The manuscript has “ superiores? ‘⁶ upper-3 ’' this is evidently an inadvertence.
