Italians, the “ moreau” of the French‚ and our “ murrey.” Posc
and Πύξος are therefore derived from the same source.

In the Tab. Voc. Syn. we have “ Morellus, est color ex rubeo
et nigro factus ;'' this is our murrey. The puzos or morelle
appears to have disappeared upon the introduction of indigo.

The γλύκασμαι or “ sostening’' of Pauselinos¹ is thus composed:
‘⁶ Glycasm.'’ “ Take two parts of flesh colour, and one part, or a
little less, of proplasm, (a dark shade colour,) unite thern in a sheH,
and you will have a glycasrn which will serve you for making the
flesh you wish.”

In the same MS. the “proplasm'' πρό πλάσμα, of Pauselin0s2‚
which is correlative with the second “ posc‘’ of TheophiluS, is thus
composed: “ Take white, ochre, green, black (the proportions are
left to the judgment of the artist). Grind all this together upon a

Pauselinos of Thessalonica, a painter of the twelfth century, was
the Raphael or Giotto of the Byzantine school³.

‘⁴ lapis viridis,” a green stone. St. Isidore writes “ prasina,” that
is, green clay, which is produced in different places, the best, how—
ever, in Lybia Cyrenesi. (Lybia Cyrenea, called by Ptolom. Pen-
tapolis, from the five cities it contained. Africa.)

The prasinus of Theophilus appears to be an acetate of copper,
'of which ‘⁴ confection'’ he gives the recipes at the end of this first
book. Theophilus afterwards mentions “ succus,” and “ viridis,”
which appears to be ‘⁴ terra verte.''

In the Sloane MS. 1754, there is the following passage: ‘⁴ Viride
