CHAPTER XIII.

OF THE GLAss CUPS WHICH THE GREEKS ORNAMENT wrm
GOLD AND SILVER.

THE Greeks indeed make from the same sapphire stones
precious drinking cupS, decorating them with gold in this
manner. Taking gold leaf, of which we have before spoken,
they form from it the likeness of men, or birds, or beasts‚ or
leaves, and place them, with water, upon the cup in whatever
place they wish, and this leaf should be somewhat thicker
(than usual). Then they take a very clear glass, like
crystal, which they themselves compose, which as soon as
it feels the heat of the fire dissolves, and grind it carefully
upon a porphyry stone with water, laying it very thinly with
a pencil over all the leaf, and, when it is dry, they place it in
the furnace in which the painted glass of windows is heated,
of which we shall speak afterwards, supplying fire from
beechwood‚ perfectly dried in the smoke. And when they
see the flame penetrate the cup, until at length it shows a
slight red colour‚ instantly withdrawing the wood, they close

the furnace, until it cool by itself, and the gold will never
be detached.

CHAPTER XIV.

THE SAME As THE PRECEDING.

ΤΗΕΥ do it also in another manner ; taking gold ground in a
mill, which is used in books, they temper it with water, (and
silver likewise,) painting small circles with it, and in them
figures, or animals‚ or birds, in varied work, and they cover
these with the very clear glass of which we have previously
spoken. Then taking glass, white, red and green, which is
used in artificial gems, they grind each one by itself upon the
porphyry stone carefully, with water, and then they‘¹ paint
little flowers and flourishes and other small things which they
