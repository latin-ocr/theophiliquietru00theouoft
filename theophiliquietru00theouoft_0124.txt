Orpiment is too valuable a colour to be lost to the artist, and it
is quite permanent upon ochres, and when kept from the contact
of all other colours. I am in possession of the several modes prac-
tised for its use, at a later day, when orpiment was in constant
use by the Italian painters, but these are reserved for a future
opportunity.

When the yellow sulphuret of arsenic is heated, it parts with a
portion of the sulphur, and the substance becomes converted into
red orpiment‚ or ‘⁶ Realgar.”

Cennino mentions the two eolours; “ Oropimento‚” the yellow,
and “ Risigallo,'' the red sulphuret, or Realgar1.

ennesii, c. 1. The fabrication of that colour which the Greeks
called ψιμύθιον, psimuthion‚ and the Romans Cerusa, or psimytbin,
is described by Theophrastus ², Dioscorides³, Vitruvius⁴ and Pliny5
in nearly the same terms, and they speak of it as a colour com-
monly used in painting. Theophrastus thus describes the process.
‘⁶ To make which, lead is placed in earthen vessels over sharp
vinegar, and after it has acquired some thickness of a kind of rust,
which it commonly does in about ten days, they open the vessels
and serape it off, as it were, in a kind of impurity3 they then re·
place (the lead) over the vinegar, repeating often the same method
of scraping, till it is wholly dissolved‚ they then beat what has
been scraped off into powder, and boil for a long time, and what
at last subsides to the bottorn of the vessel is the psimuthion.”

Pliny describes the process nearly in the same terms.

, Dioscorides adds that the principal manufactories of ceruse were
at Rhodes, at Corinth, at Lacedemon and Pozzuoli.

Vitruvius informs us that the Rhodians put vine twigs, or ten-
drils, in barrels, into which they poured vinegar, over this were
suspended sheets of lead and the barrels were closed up. After
a certain time the lead was found changed into ceruse, and
Pliny states that the Rhodian ceruse was the most esteemed,-—·
‘⁶ Laudatissimum in Rhodo.” Would the decomposition of these
