‘⁴ red arsenic” or ‘⁶ red lead.” See also CaesalpinuS‚ de Metallis,

L. 3, c. 14. Hodie sandycem, id est Cerussam ustam quousque
ut rubentem acquiescerit, vulgo minium vocant.

The minium of Vitruvius is a cinnabar. For in his chapter
on “The consideration of Minium,'’l he says, “Foditur gleba,
quae anthrax dicitur” “ emittit lachrymas argenti vivi.” An-
thrax was a term applied by the Greeks to gems or rare stones
of a red colour3 Vitruvius evidently applies it to the native cinna-
bar, as “it yields drops of quicksilver.” He calls the minium of
the moderns, or red prot-oxide of lead, “ sandaracha.'' 2 “ Cerussa
vero cum in fornace coquitur, mutato colore ad ignis incendium
efficitur sandaracha.”

But Pliny, better insormed upon these points, tells us that a
minium is made from a veined stone, from which also silver is
extracted, not from that whose liquid we call quicksilver3 ’' galena
is evidently intended, as it is by Dioscorides ³. Yet he tells us
that minium is called cinnabar by the Greeks, ‘⁶ and that a minium
called also cinnabaris is produced in the mines of Spain,” as at
this day.

An inferior minium, the “ minium secundarium ’' of Pliny, was
made by grinding the burnt and exhausted lead ore, of a red
colour.

In a chamber in the Baths of Titus a bright red was found in
an earthen vase. This was analysed by Davy, who found that it
fused into litharge, consequently that it was the true “minium ”
or red prot-oxide of lead ⁴.

When massicot is calcined in a reverberatory furnace, it gradually
assumes-a dark purple colour3 when this has taken place, the
doors should be closed, allowing the air to enter very slowly. The
longer the process of cooling the finer is the minium, and the
colour is heightened if itis kept constantly stirred, as more oxygen
is imbibed. The quantity of oxygen taken up by the lead is enor-
mous. I have been assured by a practical chemist, that twelve
parts of lead, by weight, produce thirteen of minium, if the pro-
cess has been properly conducted.
