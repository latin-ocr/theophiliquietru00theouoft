NOTES r1¹0 BOOK 111. 437

of the ninth century, but which, says M. Didron, is certainly an-
terior to the schism consummated by Michael Cerularius3 it is a
book of psalms. At the end of the MS. is a prayer, a litany where
all the orders of saints, apostles, &c., are successively invoked.
Immediately after the angels and before the apostles the patriarchs
and prophets are one by one invoked. Saint Abraham, St. Moses,
St. Aaron, St. Samuel, St. David, St. Amos, St. Habbacuc, &c.
But in the eleventh century this fraternization ceased, and the re-
spect which had until then existed in the Roman church for these

personages diminished‚ the Latins “became rather disdainful of
the Old Testament.”

Theophilus, who gives few iconographical descripffions, by his
careful directions for a practice, by which the prophets of the Old
«and the apostles of the New Testaments are fraternized, should
have lived at latest in the commeneement of the eleventh centuryl.

C. LXIII. CALAMINE.

The calamine or cadmia of the ancients, which Pliny tells was
used in the manufacture of brass, “ lapis, ex quo fit aes, cadmia
meatui-‚⁹⁹² is the rough zinc ore3 Dioscorides informs us that cad-
mia is produced during the calcination of brass, and that it attaches
itself upon the sides of the furnace ³.

¹ 'Phis respect, which the Roman church gradually lost for the holy characters of
the Old Testament, and which M. Didron designates as the “ J udaie influence,” has
been perpetuated amongst us in England, which has also otherwise been so strongly
impressed by the Byzantine genius.

Our finest Gothic cathedrals are upon the plan of the double or Greek cross3 our
liturgy greatly imbued with the writings of the Greek Fathers.

Ι insert a note of the learned M. Durand, upon the effect of J ewish and Byzan-
tine 'mfluence upon England. It is singular, that no sooner does a Frenchman ap·
proach any subject with which England is connected, than his ideas seem to run riot.
There is, however, some truth in the following. “ The names of Adam, Isaac,
Jacob, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, &c.‚ are very common in Greece 3 there is
J ew in all that. It would seem that Byzantium, nearer than Rome to Jerusalem
and the Holy Land, has not been sufficiently capable of escaping from the Old Testa-
ment. What it is proper to remark is, that Enyland, Jewisla by commerce, is Jewieh
and Byzantina in ker reliyious castam. Bentkam is called Jeremialu Reynold,
Joshua ,·- Newton, Isaac ,· Garrick, David ,· O’C‘omaell ie called Daniel. St. George,
the patron of Greece, and to whom the patriarchal church at Constantinople is dedi-
cated, is patron of England. England gives this name to the branch of the sea
which separates her from Ireland. 1⁷}ae celebrated Canniny was called Georqesss'
