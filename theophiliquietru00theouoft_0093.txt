CHAPTER XVIII.

OF GLUE OF SKINS AND STAG-HORNS.

ΤΗΕ above being caresully dried‚ take cuttings of the same
skins, dried in like manner, and carefully cut them up into
small pieceS‚ and taking the stag-horus, broken very small
with a smith's hammer upon an anvil, place them together in
a new pot, until it is half full, and fill it up with water, and
so apply fire until a third part of this water be evaporated,
so, however, that it may not boil. And you will thus try it;
moisten your fingers with this water, and if, when they have
become 0001, they adhere together, the glue is good3 but if
not, cook it until they do adhere together. Then po'ur this
glue into a clean vessel and again fill the pot with water, and
simmer it as before3 and do this four times.

‘CHAPTER XIX.

OF THE WHITE GROUND OF GYPSUM.

AFTER this take gypsum, burnt like lime, or chalk with
which skins are whitened, and carefully grind it with water
upon a stone, then place it in a baked earthen vessel, and,
pout-ing in some glue made from skins, place it over the
coals, that the glue may liquefy, and in this manner paint
over the skin very thinly with 3 pencss, and when it is dry, paint
somewhat thicker, and, if needed, paint a third time. When it
is quite dry, take the herb called shave-grass which grows
like 3 bulrush, and is ragged3 when you have gathered it in
summer yon will dry it in the sun, and will rub this whiten-
ing with it until it is made everywhere smooth and polished ¹.

¹ But if a skin is wanting for covering tablets, they are covered with oenva not
too new, with the same glue and in tha same manner. eod. Ouelpk. et Harlei. in
