dry, cover whatever of the glass is left with a light colour,
which must not be so dark as the second shadow, nor so
light as the third, but the mean between these. Which being
· dry, with the reverse of the pencil make, next the first
shadows which you made, fine lines on each side, so that,
between these tints‚ and the ¹ shadows, fine lines of that light
colour may exist. But upon the remainder make circles and
branches, and upon them flowers and leaves, in the same
manner as they are made in painted letters3 but upon grounds
which are filled with letters in colours, you should paint upon
the glass with the most delicate small branches. You can
also sometimes insert in the same circles small animals and
little birds, small insects and nude figures. In the same
manner you make grounds of the clearest white, the figures
of which grounds you ornament with sapphire‚ green, purple,
and red. Also in grounds of blue and green colour, painted
over in the same manner, and of red not painted, you make
draperies of the clearest white, than which kind of garment
none is more beautiful. From the above-named three colours
you paint boughs and leaves in borders, flowers and intri-
cacies‚ in the above order 3 and you will use the same (colour)
in the faces of figures and in the hands and feet, and every-
where in the nude members, for that colour which, in the
preceding book is called pose. You will not make much use
of yellow glass in draperies‚ unless in crowns and in those
places where gold is placed in a painting. All these things
being thus composed and painted, the glass 1s to be heated,
and the colour fixed m the furnace, which you make in this
manner.
