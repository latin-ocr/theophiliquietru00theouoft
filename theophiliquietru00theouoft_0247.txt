For painting earthenware vessels the Greeks were accustomed
to use coloured fluxes mixed with different pigments suitable to
the purpose. This art would naturally lead to that of painting

tablets, as in window work,'’ which they ornamented with gold,
laying a flux behind the leaf in order to protect it. This was
principally used in mosaic work: the decoration of vases with
gold leaf and coloured ornamental work, having been applied to
glass, as well as fictile vases and cups, became transferred to the
glass plates‚ and thus were introduced into window-work.
