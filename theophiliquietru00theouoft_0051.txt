In the accounts handed down to us, Van Eyck is de-
scribed as a elever chemist, and it is stated that he was
continually consulting works upon that science for in-
formation. The works of the Arab chemists had be-
come known: Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon, Arnold
of Villa Nova, Raymond Lully, had all lived and written
upon the “ Magnum Opus‚'’ the basis of which rested
upon sublimation and distillation, by means of which
the elixir, spirit, or excellence of all things were to be
extracted. The words of Lomazzo, which we have
· quot-ed above, would therefore probably bear a literal
meaning.

Leonardo da Vinci is stated to have followed the
manner of colouring invented by John of Bruges, and
to have thinned his oil by means of alembics. This, I
was convinced, intended, that Leonardo distilled the oil
(he himself mentions walnut oil) for the purpose of
painting.

Aware that the older Italian writers used the word
‘⁶ lambz’cco ’' as representing any chemical apparatus, yet

¹ The materials employed are llb linseed oil, {yn olys; 4 ounces
of amber in powder, bernsteen ghepulvz'rt ; (a loet is half an ounce‚)
and 1 pound litharge, spigelhars. The amber is dissolved with a
little oil over the fire; when dissolved, the oil is added hot by
degrees; the litharge, of which an enormous quantity is added, is
then put in3 it is cooked a little, and is finished. There were
various modes of making this varnish practised in Italy at a later
period. The process here described would make a very dark
varnish‚ which would require to be thinned with walnut or other
oil for use.
