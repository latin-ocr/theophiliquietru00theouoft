NOTES 'ro Boox 1. 71

‘⁶ El terzo modo la poy fare dando al dito olio quando ὲ coto tanta
raxa quanto fo l'olio, e questo ὲ secondo Ν icolao di Bertoldo.”

“ To MAKE PAm'rEns’ VARNISH.

‘⁴ Take the quantity you please of linseed oil, place it on the fire
and boil it until upon putting a pen into the boiling oil it warps as if
burnt3 and when it is cooked, take it from the fire, and cast pounded
and sifted vernix into the said oil, little by little, and remember not
to put too much at a time, because it will rise up and swell so as to
run over. And when you have put in all the vernix, replace it for
a short time upon the fire until it has become slightly hot again,
then strain it and it is done.

‘⁶ Note—that the best manner to make it is, by putting to the said
oil, Greek puch, two parts as much of the resin as there is oil.
And a third way of making it is by putting to the same oil‚ when
cooked, as much resin as there is oil, and this is according to Ni-
colao di Bertoldo.”

The use of these materials in our own country has been traced
by Walpole to a very early date. On the 2nd of August, 1239,
A. n. (23 Henry III.‚) Odo and his son were paid “ for cil, varnish
and colours bought and pictures made in the Queen’s Chamber at
Westminster.’'

The Rev. Mr. Bentham has noticed in the Archaeologia‚ v. 9,
varnish among the materials used for painting the cathedral of
Ely. In the Sacrist's annual roll of expenses from Michaelmas
(8th of Ed. ΙΙΙ. ΑΛ). 1335,) to Michaelmas following, under the
title of “ custos novis operis” and of ‘⁸ nova pictura.”

“ Item, in 20 lb. de vernyz‚ Empt. pro eodem, 5⁸. pree. lib. 3d.’‘

In the Sacrist's roll from Michaelmas 1341 to the Michaelmas
following, under the head “ Minute expenses⁹² is this:—

“ In> 6 lib. de albo ver'nish 18d. pree. lib. 3d.
In 27} lagenis olei empt. 23. 2ά.”
In the roll from Michaelmas 1346 to Michaelmas 1347.
‘⁸ In 7 lib. de vernyz empt. 21ά.”

Mr. Smith¹ has given an account of the contents of.the Rolls
in the Exchequer, which prove the use of oil and varnish during
the painting of the chapel of St. Stephen at Westminster, the date
of the earliest roll being zoth of Edward Ι. Λα). 1292.

Oil, red and white varnish and “tinctu” (probably oil of turpen-
tine) are here mentioned.
