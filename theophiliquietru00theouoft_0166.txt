the first positive direction for the use of linseed cil, as a vehicle
for paint and a varnish, is found.

This MS. is stated by Muratori¹ to be of the eighth century;
it is rather carelessly given by him, contains, directions for dyeing

‘¹ si skins, making coloured glass, the composition of colours‚ varnishes,

&c., and a description of various substances used in the arts.
Linseed oil is thus noticed in it. “ Lineleon, ex semine lini fit,''
p. 372, is the ληηλεον of Dioscorides and the λινόλαδον of the mo-
dern Greeks 3 linseed oil.

The recipe for a composition for pigments or varnish is given.
‘⁶ De compositio Linei‚” p. 380. “ Compositi03 Lineileum rb. ΙΙ.
gumma -1- (sescuncia) resina suppini ÷ Ι. Omnia trita, de-
coquantur in vaso terrae.'’

“The composition of Lineum.'' Linseed oil, 2tb.; gum san-
darach, Ῑὲζ. ; Larch (or Venice) turpentine resin, 133. All
ground, they are cooked in an earthen vessel.''

There is no doubt here of an oil varnish, or vehicle which was
used by the Greek painters. Again, “De Linele0.” “Lineleon
ezauratz'one, Lineleon liber II. gumma ÷, resina -÷- crocus soli-
dus 11.1t›. Ista trita et commisce, quemadmodum superius.'’

“ Of Lineleon.” “Linseed oilinspissated, (quasi ab exareo, to
wax dry‚) or boiled linseed oil, 2tb.; gum sandarach, 13} ; pine
resin, 133 3 solid yellow, 21'0. These, ground and mixed together
as above.” If this crocus solidus is the yellow aloes, it is a var-
nish which has been much in use at a later period in Italy. It may,
however, be an ochre, and the composition one for laying on gold;
it proves, however, the mixture of varnish with colours‚ and it is
a very curious circumstance, that at a very early period in Eng-
land painters were called ‘⁶ gilders.”

The composition of a varnish which is called “ lucidis ’' is a
singular mixture, some of the ingredients given not being, under
any circumstances, sol‘uble in oil. I give the whole chapter for
the curious.

“De lucide ad lucidare. Super colores quale fieri debet.”

The weights are in sescunciae, -:-, or h} ounce. “Lineleon ÷ IV.
