C. XXIX.

“ Take the gum which is called parabas, or barabas.”

In the manuscripts of the 13th and 14th centuries the chrystal-
lized salts are sometimes called gummi. The chrystallized urates
are called by Paracelsus “ Barnabas, or Barnaas,'’ which he de-
scribes as the “ sal petrae urinarius ς urina salis petrae.”

Barach‚ borak or borax, the native borate of seda, began
through the Arab chemists‚ or alchemists‚ to be distinguished in
the arts from the 9th century.

The Montpellier MS., already quoted in the notes to L. 1, gives
the composition of nigellum which is to be used with ‘⁶ boraxa”
as a flux3 the composition of the niello is from silver, copper, sul-
phur, and lead3 the same materials‚ although in different propor-
tions‚ as those of Theophilus, borax is therefore probably intended
by him. I give the extract:

“ Accipe plumbum, erame, argentum similiter3 confla equales
partes: ipsis in igne conflatis, cum carbone vivo misce, postea
addite sulfur, quantum ut per totum sint ista metalla et misce cum
carbone vivo, coque sulfur, et cum combustum fuerit, projice in
aliquo loco ubi sit aqua clara, et cum ‘ boraxa’ distempera, et
scribe in curvaturis quicquid vis.”

“ When you wish to make mello, take equa] parts of quicksssver, copper‚ and lead,
and put them in a vessel that they may cook together. Then take of sulphur, the
weight of six denarii, and mix it with them and stir it. Afterwasds withdraw lt
from the fire and allow it to become cold, place it in a vase and take atramentum,
tempered with wine, and make what you wish upon silver with the atramentum, and
immediately overlaying the powder of quicksilver, copper, and lead, and then melting
it, a beautiful niello may be made.”—Ab Eraclia. Ms. Le Beyzae. Paris· Art. 251.
