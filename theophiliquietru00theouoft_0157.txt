‘⁶ How THE WALLS ΑΒΕ PLASTERED.

‘⁶ When you would paint a church, commence by the higher por-
tions and finish by the lower. For this, you begin by placing a
ladder. Then take water in a large vase, and throw some with a
spoon against the wall so as to wet it. If the wall is built of
earth, scratch the earth with a trowel as much as you can, because,
above all at the vault, the lime will detach itself more tardily.
Wet it again and polish the surfaee. If the wall is in brick, you
will wet it five or six times, and you will make the plaster work of
lime, of the thickness of two fingers and more, to retain humidity,
and to allow you to take advantage of it. If the wall is in stone,
wet it only once or twice, and put a much smaller quantity of
plaster, for stone takes humidity easily and does not dry. During
winter, lay one coat of plaster in the evening, and another, more
superficial, the next morning. In the fine season, do what is the
most convenient, and, after having laid on the last couch of plaster,
equalize it well; allow it to take consistence‚ and work.”

“ How :ro DRAw WHEN PA1N‘r1NG υΡοΝ WALLs.

‘⁴ When you would draw upon a wall, smooth its surface well.
Then take a compass, and attach to both its branches pieces of
wood, so as to lengthen it as much as you wish. Attach a small
brush (pinceau) to the extremity of one of these sticks. You
will draw out the nimbus of your personages, and you will indicate
all the measures which are necessary. Then make a very slight
sketch with ochre3 finish your outlines. If you wish to correct
(effacer) anything, employ oxy (red ochre or sinoper). Retouch
the nimbus, repolish the surface well, and employ black3 polish
the drapery, and lay on the proplasm. Try to terminate very
quickly that which you have polished3 for, if you are too tardy,
a crust will form upon the surface which would not absorb the
colour. Work the face in the same manner3 you will design the
outline with a piece of bone cut to a'point‚ and quon the flesh
colour as promptly as possible, before the formation of a crust‚ as
we have before said.”

‘⁶ HOW WHITE IS PREPARED FOR PAINTING 01( WALLS.

‘⁴ Take very old lime (chalk). Try it upon your tongue; if it
is neither bitter nor astringent, but insipid like earth, it is good.
