black and succus added; with which colour also the earth
and mountains are painted. The earth and mountains are
also made with green and white, without succus, the interior
being made pale, the exterior showing shadows mixed with a
little black. All colours which are placed under others on a
wall are mixed with lime for solidity. Veneda is laid under
lazur and manisc, and under green3 red under cinnabar3
under ochre and folium, the same colours, mixed with lime.

CHAPTER XVII.

OF THE TABLETS OF ALTARS AND DOORS, AND OF THE
GLUE OF CHEESE.

'run tablets of altars, or of doors‚ are first carefully fitted
together with the joining instrument which carpenters or vat
makers use; they are then joined with the glue of cheese,
which is made in this manner. Soft cheese is cut very small,
and is washed with warin water in a small mortar with a
pestle, until, being frequently poured in, the water comes
away pure. Then thi's cheese, compressed by the hand, is
put into cold water until it hardens. After this it is very
finely ground, with another pieee of wood, upon a smooth
wooden table, and in this state it is again placed in the
mortar, and is carefully ground with the pestle, water mixed
with quick lime being added, until it is made as thick as lees.
The tablets of altars fastened together with this glue, after
they are dry, so adhere together, that neither heat nor hu-
midity are able to disjoin them. They should afterwards be
smoothed with a planing iron, which, curved and sharp in-
side‚ has two handles, so that it may be drawn by both
hands, (with which doors and shields are shaved,) until they
are made perfectly smooth. They are then covered with the
untanned skin of a horse, or ass, which is soaked in water;
as soon as the hairs have been scraped off, some water is
squeezed from it, and thus moist‚ it is superposed with the
curd glue.
