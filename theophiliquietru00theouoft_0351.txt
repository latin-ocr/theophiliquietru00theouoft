you may wish to make in enamel, whether circles, or knots‚
or small flowers, or birds, or animals‚ or figures3 and you will
arrange the small pieces delicately and carefully, each in its
place, and will fasten them with moistened flour over the
coals. When you have filled one portion, you will solder it
with the greatest care, that the slender and fine gold may not
be disjoined nor liquefy3 and do thus twice or three times,
until the separate pieces adhere a little.

All the enamels being composed and soldered in this man-
ner, take all kinds of glass which you had prepared for this
work, and breaking a particle from each piece, place all the
fragments together upon a piece of copper, each piece by
itself, and placing it in the fire arrange the coals around and
above it, and blowing carefully, you will see whether they
melt equally; if so, use them all3 if however any particle is
harder (than the rest) place it by itself. Taking separate
pieces of the proved glass‚ place them in the fire one by one,
and when each one has become glowing‚ throw it into a
copper vessel in which there is water, and it instantly flies
into small fragments, which you break with a round pestle
until made quite fine, and you will thus wash it and put it
into a clean vessel, and you cover it with a linen cloth. In
this manner you prepare the separate colours. Which being
done, take a piece of the soldered gold, and you will fasten it
upon a smooth table with wax in two places, and taking a
goose quill cut to a point, as if for writing but with a longer
beak and not split, you take out with it one of the colours of
glass, whichever you please¹. That which remains over,
replace in its small cup and cover it, and do this with each
colour until one piece is filled: taking away the wax, to which
it had adhered‚ place this piece upon athin iron, which may have
a short handle, and cover it with another iron which is hollow

like a cup, and let it be perforated finely all over, so that the
holes may be inside flat and wide, and outside finer and

the end you serape from the beak of the pen, delimtely, and will fiu up whatever
flower you wish, and how you pleaseg’'--an interpolation in the Wokfenbimel
