CHAPTER XXXVII.

OF SALT GREEN.

IF, however, you wish to make a green colour, take oak wood,
as long and as large as you like, and hollow it in the form of
a box. Then take copper and thin it into leaves, as broad as
you desire, so however that its length may cover the breadth
of the hollow wood. After this take a plate full of salt, and
pressing it down strongly, cover it with charcoal for a night,
- and on the morrow grind it carefully upon a dry stone. And
when you have taken some slender twigs, place them together
in the same hollowed wood, so that two parts of the hollow
are below and the third above them, and thus coating the
copper plates on both sides with pure honey, sprinkling over
them the ground salt, you will fix them, joined together, upon
those twigs, covering carefully with another wood fitted for this,
so that no vapour can come out. Afterwards make an open—
ing, to be bored in an angle of the same wood, through which
you can pour warm vinegar, or hot urine, so as to fill a third
part of it,'and then close the passage. You should put this
wood in such a place that you can wholly cover it with stable
dung. After four weeks raise the covering, and serape off,
and keep whatever you find upon the copper, and again re—
placing it, cover it as above.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

OF SPANISH GREEN.

11³, however, you wish to make Spanish green, take plates of
copper thinned, and seraping them carefully on both sides,
pour upon them pure and warm vinegar, without honey and
salt, and place them together in a smaller hollow piece of
wood in the order above. Aster two weeks examine and
serape it, and do thus until you have colour sufficient.
