CHAPTER LXVI.

oF THE COMPOSITION OF BRAss.

WHEN they are glowing‚ take calamine, of which Ι have be-
fore spoken, very finely ground, with coals, and arrange them
in each cup about one sixth part full, and fill it quite with the
above-mentioned copper, and cover with coals. From time
to time prick the openings below with 3 slender and curved
piece of wood, that they may not by chance be obstructed‚
so that the ashes may fall out, and the wind may have more
access. And when the copper is altogether melted‚ take a
slender iron, long and curved and fixed to 3 wooden handle,
and carefully stir it, that the calamine may be mixed with
the copper. But after this, with the long forceps slightly
raise the vases sepamtely, and remove them a little from
their places, that they may not by chance adhere to the
hearth3 and again, as before, place calamine in all of them,
and refill them with copper, and cover them with coals.
When they have anew become quite fluid, again carefully stir
them, and taking out one vase with the forceps, pour out the
whole into the trench dug in the earth, and return the vase
to its place. Taking calamine, directly replace it as before,
and place upon it as much of the copper which you poured
out as the vessel can contain. And being liquefied as be—
fore, stir it and re-add calamine, and fill it up with the copper
(you) poured out, and leave it to be melted‚ Do this to each
of the vases 3 and when in all it has become melted‚ and has
been stirred for a long time, pour out as before and keep it
until you have need. This mixture is called brass, from
which caldrons are cast, but it cannot be gilt when the
copper has not been entirely purged from lead before mixture.
Then in making brass which can be gilt, begin thus.
