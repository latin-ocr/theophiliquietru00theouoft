CHAPTER IV.

OF THE MIXTURE OF ASHES ΛΝΒ SAND.

THESE being thus arranged, take beech-wood logs, completely
dried in the smoke, and light a large fire in the larger furnace
on both sides. Then taking two parts of the ashes, of which
we have before spoken, and a third part os sand, carefully
purged of earth and from the stones which you may have
brought from the water, mix them in a clean place. When
they have been long and well mixed together, taking them
up with the iron trowel, place them in the smaller part of the
furnace upon the upper hearth, so that they may be heated,
and when they have begun to grow hot immediately stir them
with the same trowel that they may not liquefy and be formed
into a mass by the heat of the fire3 and do this for the space

of one night and day.

CHAPTER V.

oF THE WORK VASES ΛΝΒ OF HEATING WHITE GLAss.

DUR1NG which time take white clay, of which jars are made,
and, drying it, grind it caresully, and, pouring water upon it,
beat it strongly with a piece of wood, and make your vases,
which must be large at the top but small below, having a
small lip round the mouth, curved inwardly. When they are
dry take them with the pincerS, placing them in the opening
of the glowing furnace adapted for this, and with the trowel
taking up the heated ashes mixed with sand, fill all the vases
in the evening, and supply dry wood during the whole night,
that the glass from the ashes and sand, being fully liquefied,

may be cooked.
