CHAPTER XCVIII.

OF THE rVY AND OF LAKE.

ΑΤ your request, dearest brother, that Ι should discourse to
you of the ivy, which the poets and artists much loved, on
account of the secret powers which they recognised it con-
tained within itself :—for the songs of poets, when they had
been recited in the theatre before an assembly of the Romans,
were accustomed to be crowned with ivy t—the ancient artists
also invented many colours from this, one of which, in
writing, I can show you. In the month of March, when plants
and trees take up their sap from mother earth, take an auger
and perforate the small boughs of the ivy in places, and a
gummy liquid will flow out from them, from which a blood
colour is made, by seething, which is called lake. Seeth
therefore the gum liquor, which I have before mentioned to
you, in urine, and you will have the blood colour, which is
useful in writings and paintings. From this also the “ par-
cia ”¹ is made, which ornaments rams and goats’ skins with
a rose colour.

CHAPTER XCI X.

OF A GREEN COLOUR.

Snonm) one wish to make a green colour fit for writing let him
take the green leaves of the plant which is commonly called
nightshade, and carefully grind it upon a marble stone with
white chalk until they be quite liquid, and best suited for the
purpose of writing. This being done, dip a pen, or anoint a
pencil in this colour, and illuminate capital letters which you
wish to ornament with the same colour. But beware,
brother, that you do not put too much chalk with the juice of

the leaves.
