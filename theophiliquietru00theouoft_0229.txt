into the ground, and reaching to the top of the window3 and
on the left of the furnace‚ that is, on your right, near the
same window, let a small trench be made in clay. Then,
the glass being cooked, take the wood with the wheel and
iron, which is called the spit‚ and place the end of it in the
vase of glass, and taking out the little which may have ad-
hered to it, prick it strongly into the wood, that the glass may
be pierced through, and instantly warm it in the flame, and
strike it twice upon the wood, that the glass may be dilated,
and with quickness revolve your hand with the same iron‚ that
‚ the ring may be enlarged in the circle; and so revolving,
make it descend as far as the wheel, that it may become
smooth. This being instantly thrown into the trench, make
as many as you wish in the same manner. But if you wish
to vary your rings with other colours, when you have taken
and transpierced the glass with the pointed iron, take, from
another vase glass of another colour‚ surrounding the glase-
of the ring with it in the manner of a thread3 then, warmed
in the flame as above, finish itin a similar manner. You can
also place upon a ring glass of another kind, as a gem, and
warm it in the flame that it may adhere.
