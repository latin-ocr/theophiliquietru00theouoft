Leviel, de Piles‚ and other French writers are of a much later
period, but will perhaps afford information if required. Neri ap—
pears to be the source from which most of these authors have
drawn.

The relations which the Venetians held at a very early period
with the East, and the constant intercourse they maintained with
the Greeks of the lower empire‚ gave facilities in this art at
a comparatively early period. The commerce they monopolized
in white and coloured glass became an important feature in their
statistics; this branch of industry and art might, with the com-
mand we possess of material and facilities, be developed to a great
extent in this country.

There are many processes here described which will repay the
trouble of perusal to the most scientific of our artists; those,
however, are not of the class which would turn from any inquiry
upon the subject during the present state of conflicting opinions,
when the very principles of the art which formerly led to its per-
section are questioned, or neglected.

The principles laid down by Theophilus must be studied by the
glass painter and again placed as the foundation of his labours;
modern chemistry has, doubtless, supplied him with means, in
many instances far beyond what his predecessors have enjoyed, in
the pursuit of this art, but there are yet conditions to be fulfilled
which principally depend upon himself. The glass painter should
well weigh the propriety of > striving to rival the grey demi-tints
of the oil painters, or aiming at the productiori of effects to which
the nature of his art is in opposition ¹. It was from careful con—
sideration and long experience that the art of glass painting be—
came digested into the excellence of the 15th and 16th centuries 3
impotency, assuredly‚ had no share in principles followed. That
the apparent simplicity of the methods of the Byzantine and
Gothic glass painters, the powerful and harmonicus effects re-
sulting from a skilful arrangement and breadth of colour, to which
Theophilus directs the attention of the artist, although allied
to meagre invention, poor drawing, and incomplete execution, car—-
ried them triumphantly through their ordeal, the remains of the
works, executed under the influence of this school, attest. When
