Although the whole work of Theophilus abounds
with curious and valuable information, yet the allusion
to the practice of painting with colours ground in oil
has perhaps elicited more attention and remark than
any other part of the treatise, on account of the gene-
rally received opinion, drawn from the statement of
Vasari ¹, which has been followed without further inquiry

brothers John and Hubert Van Eyck, in 1410.

This statement has been so completely refuted that
further labour is needless on this point. Horace
Walpole, the Rev. Mr. Bentham‚ and Mr. Smith, have
shown that the art of painting in oil was practised in
our own country from an early period up to the fifteenth
