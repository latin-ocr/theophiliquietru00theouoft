handle with the pincerS, so that when covered you will place
it carefully and arrange the coals round and above it every-

on every side until the coals glow equally. You have also a
wing of a goose, or other large bird, which is extended and
tied to wood, with which you will wave and fan strongly all
over it, until you perceive between the coals that the holes
of the iron quite glow inside, and thus you will cease to fan.

until you remove all the coals, and you will again wait until
the holes of the iron grow black inside, and so raising the
iron by the handle, you place it, covered as it is, in the furnace,
behind, in a corner until it has become quite cold. Then
opening it you take out the enamel and will wash it, and will
again fill it and melt as before, and you do thus until, melted
equally everywhere, it has become full. In this manner you
compose the remaining pieceS.
