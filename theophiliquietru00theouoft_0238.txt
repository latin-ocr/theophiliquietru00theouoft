drachms of good azure, fine, which can sustain fire without lesing
its colour3 grind it fine with the cristal powder, put it in a pot and
allow it to cook three days and three nights‚ then extinguish the

fire and allow it to coel, and you will find the glass melted and well
coloured like a sapphire.''

Paul de Canotanto¹ places this beyond a doubt, for he mentions

“ lapis lazuli '⁹ as the substance to be employed for tinging glass

O. XV. “ OF THE GLASS CALLED GALLIEN.”

Theophilus having taught the processes for making varieties of
green and a blue glass, would proceed to describe the manufacture
of a red. The origin of the term ‘⁴ Gallien,” as applied to a red
glass, is open to conjecture, whether from the Greek, “ καλὸς,”
