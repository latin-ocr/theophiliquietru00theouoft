native, the other factitious¹. The native, which was found in
Spain, was hard and stony, as was also that brought from Colchis.
The factitious (which does not appear to be a cinnabar) came from
Ephesus in the form of a saud, shining like scarlet, which was
ground and washed. Hill in his notes to Theophrastus2 thinks
that this latter substance was the “Sil Atticum¹’ of the Romans,
injudiciously confounded, he states, by Vitruvius with the Ochra
Attica of the ancients. Hill, however, produces no reason or
support for this assertion. The ‘⁶ Sil Atticum,” was of a golden
colour, which was altered in its hue by burning. The origin of the
term is probably σέλας, fulgor, auro similis.

There were the “ Sil Atticum‚” Marmor-osum, and Pressum, vel
Syricum.

The factitious cinnabar was more likely a true minium, the in-
vention or introduction of Callias the Athenian. (See Minium.)

The “Native Cinnabar,” however, of Theophrastus was identical
with ours, it was vermilion, or sulphuret of quicksilver, and that
writer relates the process of extracting the metal from the ore by
“ rubbing it with vinegar with a brass pestle in a brass mortar-”³
During this process the brass would be attacked by the aeid, and,
through the affinityof the copper for the sulphur, the cinnabar
would be reduced to the metallic state.

Dioscorides tells that ‘⁴ a cinnabar is worked in Spain⁴, and that
during the operation the workmen cover the sace with a skin
because of the (mercurial) vapours dangerous to inhale;” he like-
wise describes the process os extracting quicksilver from cinnabar.

Pliny, likewise, describes a “ Cinnabar or Minium ” ‘⁶ whose pro-
duce we have called quicksilver,” “ cujus vomicam argentum vivum*
appellavimus.’' ⁵ ’

Cinnabar was the “ Minium” of Vitruvius, who gives a process
for using it in staining *walls of a red colour⁶.

Cinnabar has been confounded with the ‘⁶ Miltos” of the Greeks,
which is a red ochreous 'earth and the most ancient red colour
known. (SeeSinopis3 also Ezekiel, c. 23, v. 14.)
