CHAPTER XXXIII.

OF HEATING THE GOLD.

TAxE gold, of whatsoever sort it may be, and beat it until thin
leaves are made in breadth three fingers, and as long as
you can. Then cut out pieces that are equally long and wide,
and join them together equally, and perforate through all with
a fine cutting iron. Afterwards take two earthen pots proved
in the fire, of such a size that the gold can lie flat in them,
and break a tile very small, or clay of the furnace burned and
red, weigh it, powdered, into two equal parts, and add to it a
third part salt for the same weight3 which things being slightly
sprinkled with urine, are mixed together so that they may not ad-
here together, but are scarcely wetted, and put a little of it upon
a pot about the breadth of the gold, then a piece of the gold
itself, and again the composition, and again the gold, which
in the digestion is thus always covered, that gold may not be
in contact with gold 3 and thus fill the pot to the top, and
cover it above with another pot, which you carefully lute
round with clay, mixed and beaten, and you place it over the
sire, that it may be dried. In the mean time compose a fur-
nace from stones and clay, two feet in height, and a foot and
a half in breadth, wide at the bottom, but narrow at the top,
where there is an opening in the middle, in which project
three long and hard stones, which may be able to sustain the
flame for a long time, upon which you place the pots with
the gold, and cover them with other tiles in abundance. Then
supply fire and wood, and take care that a copious fire is not
wanting for the space of a day and night. In the morning,
taking out the gold, again melt, beat and place it in the fur-
nace as before. Again also, after a day and night, take it
away, and mixing a little copper with it, melt it as before, and
replace it upon the furnace. And when you have taken it
away a third time, wash and dry it carefully, and so weighing
it, see how much is wanting, then sold it up and keep it.
