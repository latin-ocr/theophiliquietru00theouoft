xxxiv PREFACE.

having always found that by stillare or assotzfflz'are per
Zambz'cco ‹listillation was intended, while filtration was de-
scribed as wallare pei-filtro, it became necessary to seek
for any precedent that distilled linseed, or Walnut oil,
was used in the art of painffing, experimenting, at the
same time, at home. Ι was fortunate enough to suc-
ceed in both instances ¹.

¹ I think it better to give the result of the experiment as I noted
it down at the time it was tried, without further comment than that
it is one which should be attempted by no inexperienced hands3
the explosive nature of the gas produced rendering the process
highly dangerous to an unskilful person, although a very simple
and easy one to the chemist, or other operator.

WALNUT OlL: 1'rs DisrLLA110N.—MARCH‚ 1845, and JULY 25,1845.

4 oz. distilled in a glass retort and receiver, over a small char-
coal fire without flame.

Water was the first product3 then came over a light-coloured
empyreumatic oil‚ which gradually became of a darker colour,
mixed with water during the whole process of distillation.

The ebullition in the retort was at first great, but it gradually
lessened as the oil became ofgreater substance. The heat is required
to be increased to keep up the vapour producing the distilled oil.
As the process continued, this vapour became more abundant, and
a quantity of gas was liberated‚ to allow of the escape of which the
stopper in the receiver must be greased and loosely dropped into
its place; care should be taken to visit this often, in order to guard
against explosion. lt appears to me during this process that oil
will not spontaneously take fire at a great heat; it requires contact
with flame or a red heat in order to do so.

Carbonic aeid and carburetted hydrogen gas are the principa}
gases produced. This mixture of gases, probably owing to the
great excess of carburetted hydrogen, is highly inflammable: it is
the productiori of this, not of a highly inflammable volatile oil,
which causes oil, raised to a very high temperature, to take fire
when in contact with flame, or highly heated bodies, such as red-
hot iron, διο,

Volatile oils of two specific gravities were produced3 the first
