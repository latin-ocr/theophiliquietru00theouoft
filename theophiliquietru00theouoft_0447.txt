CHAPTER XC.

OF IRON.

laon is formed in the earth, in form of stones, which (iron)
is dug up in the same manner as the copper, above mentioned,
and it is broken, and is mixed together in lumps, it is then
melted in the iron worker’s furnace, and it is hammered that
it may become fit for any kind of work. It is called Calibs,
from the mount Calybe, in which the most is known of its
practice3 wherefore it is prepared in the same manner that it
may become fit for work. When, therefore, you shall have
prepared the iron, and have made bits from it, or other eques-
trian utensils, and wish to decorate them with gold or silver,
take the purest silver, and thin it much by hammering.
Then you have a wooden wheel, of oak, a foot in dia-
meter and turned, which must be narrow at the outer part,
and everywhere thick in the middle, where another circular
wood is fixed on to it, in which it can be revolved‚ to which
also, at one end, another circular wood may be placed, with
which it can be turned round. And when you have adapted
this wheel between two small columns, make about its outer
edge small cuttings like steps, which incline backwards; these
columns, in which the wheel is displayed, must be firmly
fixed upon a bench lengthwise, so that the round wood may
be on the right hand. There may also stand yet another
column at the left hand, in front, near the wheel, in which a
thin wood must be fixed, so that it may lie upon thp wheel
and have at its extremity a small piece of steel, of the length
and breadth of the smallest finger nail, firmly fixed through
an opening, and extremely sharp, so that when the wheel is
revolved‚ this wood may always fall from one step to another,
that being so vibrated‚ the steel may cut into whatsoever is
applied. When you have filed a spur smoothly, place it over
the glowing coals until it has become black, and hold it,
having become cold, in the left hand, and revolve the wheel
with the right, and applying it to the steel, cut finely over the
