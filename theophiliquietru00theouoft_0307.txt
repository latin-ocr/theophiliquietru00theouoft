TRANSLATION. 237

If you wish to ornament which ribs with niello, take heed
of this, that the silver be thicker, and so act that one rib may
be gilt and the other blackened; it is always necessary that
they should be in pairs. When you have beaten out these, file
them evenly, and portray Greek foliage in those places which
you wish to make black, and carve with a bold stroke, and
you sculpture their grounds with graceful circles and with
fine work ; then compose the niello in this manner.

OF NIELLO.

TAxE pure silver, and divide it into two equal weights‚ add-
ing to it a third part of pure copper. When you have placed
these three quantities into a cast metal cup, weigh as much
lead as the half of the copper which you have mixed with
the silver weighs, and taking yellow sulphur break it very
small, and put the lead and part of this sulphur upon a small
copper vessel‚ and place the rest of the sulphur in another
cast metal cup. And when you have liquefied the silver with
the copper, stir it evenly with charcoal, and instantly pour into
it the lead and sulphur from the small copper cup, and again
mix it well together with the charcoal‚ and with quickness
pour it into the other molten cup upon the sulphur which you
had put into it, and then putting down the small vase with
which you have poured out, take that into which you have
cast it and place it in the fire until (the contents) liquefy, and
again stirring it together pour into the iron crucible. Before
this cools beat it a little, and warm it a little, and again beat
it, and do thus until it is quite thinned. For the nature of
niello is such, that if it is struck while cold it is immediately
broken and flies to pieces, nor should it be made so warm as
-to glow, because it instantly liquefies and flows into the
ashes. The niello being made thiu, put it into a deep and
thick cup, and pouring water upon it, break it up with a
