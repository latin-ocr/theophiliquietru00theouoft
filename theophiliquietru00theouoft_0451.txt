CHAPTER xo1.

OF ΒΟ LDERI NG IRON.

TmN rings are also made from iron, which are placed upon
the handles of iron instruments‚ which cannot be made
firm by themselves, a thin piece of copper is folded round
these at the join‚ and a little clay is placed around it. This
being dry, when, being blown upon, it has become glowing
under the coals before the furnace, the melted copper in-
stantly flows around and solders it. In this manner also
tinned keys, and any other things in iron can be soldered.
But should you wish to make looks with which clothes chests
are fastened, beat a thin pieee of iron, and bend it round
another round iron, and join a bottom to it above and below.
Then place round it small hoops of the same iron, and be-
tween them small flowers or circles as you may wish, so,
however, that one small piece may always impinge upon
another that it may adhere and cannot fall off. Mix together
also two parts of copper and a third of tin, and grind it with
the pestle in an iron vase very finely, and burning the wine-
stone, add to it a little salt and mix it with water, and anoint-
ing it around sprinkle this powder about it. Which being
dry, you again overlay this mixture more thickly, and placing
it upon the embers and carefully covering it about, as the
silver above, you will solder it in the same manner; and,
having cooled by itself, you will wash it. You can solder
whatever you wish, in iron, in this manner, which can,
however, in no way be gilt. Whatever you may wish to tin
over, in iron‚ file it first, and before you may touch it with
the hand, throw it newly filed into a pot of melted tin with
grease, and stir it with the tongs until it becomes white, and
being taken out, shake it strongly, and clean it with bran and
a linen cloth. When you have made iron looks and bindings of
caskets and doors, you warm them lastly and anoint them with
pitch‚ but the nails are tinned. When you have made the stir—
rups, bits and saddle appendages of humble clerks and monks‚
and have filed them smoothly, warm them moderately and
