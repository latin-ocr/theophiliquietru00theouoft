LETTERS.

ΤΑΚΕ a file and that metal (you may choose) and make
a powder by filing. Afterwards take the gum of the plum—trec
and put it into aeid, leave it for a day and night and after-
wards take it out and put it into clear water, somewhat warm‚
and leave it there a day and night. Afterwards take the gum
and filings and grind them strongly upon a stone, and temper
