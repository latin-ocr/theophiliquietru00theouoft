CHAPTER XXV.

OF CASTING THE RODS.

AFTER these things make a hearth for yourself where yon can
melt- lead, and in the hearth a hollow, in which you can
place a large earthen vessel, which you line inside and out
with clay beat up with dung, that it may be the more firm,
and light a large fire over it. And when it has become dry
place the lead upon the fire inside the pot, that, when it is
liquefied, it may flow into it. In the mean time, opening the
rod-mould, place it over the charcoal, so that it may become
warm; and you must have a piece of wood a yard in length,
which is round at the end which is held in the hand, but at the
other flat and wide, to the size of four fingers, where it is cut
across as far as the centre, according to the breadth of the
iron, in which incision you place this mould hot and closed
together, and you will so hold it in the 11p1'2er part with the
hand slightly bent back, that, in the lower part, it may stand
upon the ground, and taking the small iron spoon warmed,
take out the liquefied lead, and pour it into the mould: and
immediately place the spoon upon the fire, that it may be
always warm, and casting the mould from the wood upon the
ground, open it with a knife, and taking out-the rod again,
shut it and replace it in the wood. If, however, the lead is
not able to flow in the mould to the bottom, cast again in the
better warmed moissd, and you will regulate it so that it may
become full, because if it becomes all of an equal tempera-
ture, you can cast more than forty rods with one heating,
