CHAPTER XXIV.

OF GOLD LEAF.

TAKE Greek parchment ¹, which is made from linen eloth,

and you will rub it on both sides with a red colour which is ⁷

burned from sinoper, that is ochre, very finely ground and
dry, and polish it with a beaver's tooth, or that of a bear or
wild boar, very carefully‚ until it becomes shining, and that
the colour may adhere through the friction. Then cut up
this parchment with scissors, into square pieces, to the size
of four fingers, equally broad and long. Asterwards make
a kind of purse of vellum parchment, of the same dimension
and strongly sewed, ample enough that you may fill into it
many pieces of reddened parchment. Which being done,
take pure gold and make it very thin with a hammer upon
an even auvil, very carefully‚ so that there be no fracture in
it, and cut it into four parts to the measure of two fingers.
Then place in this purse one piece of reddened parchment,
and upon it one piece of gold in the midst, and then parch—
ment, and again gold; and do thus‘until you have filled up
the purse, and so that the gold may always be placed inside.
Τέω have a mallet cast from yellow brass, small towards the

ndle, and large in the flat part, with which you strike the
purse upon a large and flat stone, not heavily, but mode-

‚ rately3 and when you have frequently inspected it, you will

consider whether you wish to make the gold very thin or
moderately thick. If, however, the gold should have over-
spread in thinning and have exceeded the limits of the purse,
cut it off with small and light scissors made altogether for
this use. This is the fashioning of gold leaf. When you
