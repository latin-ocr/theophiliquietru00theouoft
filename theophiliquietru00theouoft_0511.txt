No'rEs 'ro Boox 111. 441

The “ huso ” is the sturgeon. M. de l’Escalopier remarks that

this word, of Germanic etymology, may strengthen the belief in
the Germanic origin of our author.

The ancients had a method of sostening and bending ivory by
immersion in different solutions of salts in aeid. Eraclius has a
chapter on this. “ Should you wish to bend ivory and ornament
it.” Take sulphate of potass, (glumen rotundum ¹,) fossil salt, (sal
gemma, muriate of soda‚) and vitriol, (calcanthum, sulphate of
copper,) these are ground with very sharp vinegar in a brass mortar.
Into this mixture the ivory is placed for three days and nights.
This being done, you will hollow out a piece of wood, as you

please. The ivory being then placed in the hollow you direct it,
and will bend it to your will.

In the MS. Sloane, 416, p. 40, already quoted, is a similar re-
cipe, with the addition that these matters are to be distilled in
equal parts, (per alembicum,) this would yield muriatic aeid, with
the presence of water3 the MS. adds that ‘⁶ infused in this water
half a day, ivory is made so soft that it can be cut like wax.

And when you wish it hardened, place it in white vinegar and it
becomes hard.”

C. XCIII. RUBRICA.

The rubrica, or rubea radix, was the ἔρυθρόδανον of the Greeks;
the red root, or madder.

Walnut oil is here alluded to as used in the arts for the purpose
of preserving ornaments in ivory.

C. XCIV. “CHRISTALLUM.”

That crystal was a stone produced by the long continued action
of cold upon water is but the opinion of Pliny, perpetuated by
our author. “Contraria huic causa crystallinum facit, gelu vehe-
mentiore concreto. Non aliubi certe reperitur, quam ubi maxime
hybernae nives rigent: glaciemque esse certum est: unde et nomen
Graeci dedere.” Plato taught that condensed water became ul«

would be added to this composition.
