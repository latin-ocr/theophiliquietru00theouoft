Suger‚ who was employed by Louis le Gros to direct the works
at St. Denis in the embellishment of the Abbey, tells us that “ the
workmen pounded ‘ sapphires ’ in abundance, and burnt them in
(or upon) the glass, to give it the colour of azure.''¹

In the Sloane collection of MSS. in the British Museum,
No. 1754, of the early part of the fourteenth century, is a short
treatise on colouring crystal. After directing that the crystal be
several times heated and well washed, it proceeds—-

“ Vous prendrez un pot de terre plumbe de dens, et pus si
pernez une livre de vostre poudre de cristas et de mye lyvre de
vostre sel niter et de sans de verre, vi medlez ove vostre poudre

de cristal, vous le criblez bien ensemble vi les metez en vostre pot '

vi covrierez cel pot de un covercel ke seyt en milu perce. Vi
devez avez un tuel de fer ke pus entrez en cel perce, par ou la
fumosite puse isser, et ce pot deyt byen estre arsilez tot en
viroun.” This is placed in the fire for a day and night. It then
contlnues:

“Who wishes to make a precious green, clear and bright
stone from the crystal here composed‚ must take calcined lead
(prenge cendres de plumb ars mult menu criblez)‚ and grind
it very fine. I will tell you how you must make this calcined
lead. Melt the lead in a round pot, take powder of orpiment finely
pulverized, you throw it upon the lead when it is melted, stir it
well until the lead is burnt to powder and becomes a cinder, then
take this cinder and grind it in a mortar.’' (This is a litharge, the
protoxide of lead.)

100 drachms of this ‘⁶ cristal ’⁹ and two drachms and a half of
this “ calcined lead” are then ground, sisted and washed, and
dried in the sun. “ Then you take 100 drachms of this cristal
and two and ahalf of the' finely sifted lead, place these in an
earthen pot which can sustain a great fire, you cook a day and a
whole night, then extinguish the fire and you will find a beautiful
and bright stone, and green as an emerald'l’

‘⁸ If you wish to make SAPPHIRE (Safir) from this ⁸ cristal,’ take
of the cristal 100 drachms, and of the calcined lead five drachms,

you cook them (vi les quisez) a whole night and day ; when melted
you break it up in a mortar and sift (saciez) it small and take five
