above them, and cover with clay. And when the clay has a
third time become dry, place iron hoops around so closely
that there may not be more than the breadth of a hand be-
tween two hoops, upon which hoops place two layers of clay.
These being dry, turn the mould upon its side and cut a large
hollow in the inside, in the circumference and in depth, that
it may not remain thicker than one foot, because, were the
mould whole within, it could not be raised, on account of the
exceeding weight, nor be cooked through, for the thickness.
Then make a cave in the place where you wish this mould
to enter for cooking, deep, according to the height of the
breadth‚ and make a strong base, as a foundation, with stones
and clay upon which the mould will stand at the v height
of one foot, so that in the middle a rough space as a path, a
foot and a half wide, may remain on either side, in which the
fire can burn under the mould. Which being done, fix four
posts, projecting upwards to the level of the ground, about
this foundation, and immediately fill up the cave with earth.
You directly lower the mould and establish it evenly in the
midst of these posts, and begin to cast out the earth on one
side, from under the mould. And when it shall have inclined,
dig on the other side, until it again incline itself there, and do
thus on every side until the mould lie in an even manner
upon the stone base. Directly withdrawing the posts, which
were fixed for this purpose alone, that they might guide the
mould down straightly, and stones which can sustain the fire,
being taken, and clay, make the mouth of the furnace on
each side, before that space of the path which you had left in
the midst of the base, and build the furnace around at the
distance of half a foot from the mould. And when, in
working, you have reached the middle of the mould, clear
the mouth of the furnace‚ and make an opening in the rim of
the mould itself, on each side, through which the grease may

be able to flow out, and vessels being placed underneath, ,

apply fire and dry wood. And when, the mould being heated,
the grease has commenced to issue out, finish the warm fur-
nace from the foot to the top of the mould, and lay a cover
over the mouth with clay or iron. But the grease being
