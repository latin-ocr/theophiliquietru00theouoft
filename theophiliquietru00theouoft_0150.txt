the Alexandrian blue, afterwards made at Pozzuoli and used, Davy
tells us, in the Baths of Titus and in the Aldobrandine marriage. ⁴
These azures had not changed at all. In an excavation made at
Pompeii, at which Davy was present, a small vase was found filled

with a pale blue colour, which Davy asserts was “ a mixture of
lime and Alexandrian frit.''

Other azure colours were made by the Greek artists for the
purpose of painting and illuminating.

Azurium or ‘⁶ lazurium’' is the colour otherwise called ‘⁴ celestis
· or celestinus,’' otherwise ‘⁶ blancus,” otherwise ‘⁶ Persus,” and
elsewhere “ethereus” Tab. Voc. Syn.

In a collection of medical and other recipes at the end of the
MS. of Theophilus, and which have not been written later than the
commencement of the thirteenth century, I find two very·curious
modes of making “azurium‚” the first of which is made from
silver, and is, I confess, to me, incomprehensible, as an oxide of
silver would be the result of the process instead of a blue colour.
The second is from copper. I give the text for the curious.

“ SI V1s FACERE AzumuM orriMUM.

“ Accipe ollam novam et mitte in eas laminas purissimi argenti
quantas volueris‚*et pone illam ollam in vindemiam quae est pro-
jecta de torculari sive de tina, et cooperi ollam cum laminis de
ipsa vindemia et serva diligenter usque ad xv. dies, et sic aperies
ollam illam, et siccata quod est in laminis, rade in mundissimo
vase. Quod si amplius volueris fac iterum similiter.'’

“ s1 VIs AthJM AzumUM FACERE.

“ Accipe ampullam de purissimo cupro et imple fortissimo aceto,
et cooperi diligenter os *ejuS, ne aliquid humoris vel vaporis possit
exire, et addens si necesse est ad hoc, tenacem terram vel pastam,
et ipsam ampullam ita clausam pone in aliquo calido loco aut in
terram aut in foenum projectum de stabulo et sic dimitte per unum
mensem et tunc aperi illam ampullam et quod inveneris in ea
dimitte ad solem siccare.’'

This last recipe would form an oxide of copper, which by the
continued action of the aeid would become a sub-acetate3 this, de-
composed by lime, would yield vei-diter.

These recipes are found frequently among the notices upon
zolours of the Byzantine school, the silvei· being used alone, but
