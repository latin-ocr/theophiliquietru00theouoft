Petrus, of St. Audemar1, gives the method of making the best
verrnilion, ‘⁴ vermiculum optimum.’' ‘⁶ If you wish to make the
best vermilion, take a glass bottle and cover it with a lute outside3
and take one part of quicksilver‚ by weight, and two, by weight,
of white or yellow coloured sulphur. Put it into the above bottle,
which you afterwards place on four stones, and, laying a very
slight fire of coals round the bottle, cover its mouth with a tile,
and when you see the smoke come white from the mouth of the
bottle, close it, but when a smoke as red as the vermilion shall
come out, take it from the fire and you will have the best ver-
milion.” Similar recipes are found amongst the medical writers of
the thirteenth and fourteenth century, but are mostly repetitions.

The Greeks called ‘⁶ Dragon’s Blood,” κιννάβαρι Ἰνδικον, Indian
cinnabar.

ExunRA or Exnmm. ’ἔζησα οι· έζοῦσα, the aorist tense of Ζῶ, vivo,
may perhaps be the origin of this word. From Ζῶ is ε’ξέχῶ, to
protrude or “ etre en saillant.’' The exudra of Theophilus is a
dark colour intended to relieve and finish the flesh, in the artist’s
language “ to bring it out.'’

for making the flesh colour, otherwise called cedra.'’²

Fmvus Coma, c. 1. Theophilus here describes the process
followed in his time for making the ‘⁸ Cerussa usta'’ of the ancients‚
and the “ Massicot” or “Minium’' of the moderns, according to
the duration of 'the heat employed.

This colour was also called “ Arxica ” or “Arsicon’' by the By-
zantines. Arsicon or arxica is like orpiment; it is a yellow colour,
and by being mixed with the sap of the plant called scaldalussa‚ a
green is made3 and the sap of other plants is good for this. Id.

There is no doubt that the ‘⁴ Arxica ” of Cennino Cennini is mas-
sicot‚ or a prot-oxide of lead. “ Giallo ὲ un colore, che si chiama
arzica,”³ &c. There is a yellow colour which is called “arzica,”
which colour is the produce qschemistry, and is little used. He adds,
“this colour is very delicate, loses its force in the air, is not good
