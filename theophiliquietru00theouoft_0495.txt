The reader will probably remark the expedient to furnish carbon

The expressions “very pure gold and silver‚” “ purest gold‚”
found in Scriptum, warrant us in the belief that cupellation is a
process of very ancient date. “ Take away the dross from the
silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.”1 “As
the fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold : so is a man to
