and so it is carefully dried.

Then, from the same (hearth), a wall may be made with
minute stones and the same clay, after the fashion of a pot,
so that from the middle upwards it may be somewhat nar-
rower, and may be higher than broad, and it is bound round
with four or five iron bands, and the same clay is carefully
plastered inside and out. Which being done, glowing coals,
mixed with cinders, are placed in, and soon the wind, enter-
ing through the holes below, nourishes the flames without
the breath of the bellows, and whatever metal is placed in
immediately liquefies by itself. Afterwards the small cups
necessary for this work are made in this manner.

CHAPTER LXV.

OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE VASES.

ΤΑΚΕ fragments of old vases, in which copper or brass has been
before fused, and break them small upon a stone. Then take
the earth of which pots are made, of which kinds there are
two, one white, another grey; of these the white is useful for
colouring gold, but the other for composing these vases3 and
when you have ground it together very finely, you mingle
this crude earth with the other, in proportion‚ that is, to the
burnt material which you first ground, in this manner: Take
any vase and fill it twice with this crude earth, and three
times with the burnt (fragments), so that two parts may
be crude and three burnt, and placing thern together in a
large vase, pour warm water over them, and beat strongly with
mallets and the hands until it has become quite tenacious.
Then cut wood round, to the size which you wish the vase to
possess, according to the capacity of the furnace, and upon it
you will form a small vase, and being made, you directly
cover’it roundwith dry ashes, and so place it near the fire
until it be dry. In this manner make as many vases as you
