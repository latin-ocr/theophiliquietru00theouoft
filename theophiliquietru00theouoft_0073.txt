CHAPTER I.

OF THE MIXTURE OF COLOURS Fon THE NUDE.

THE colour which is called flesh eolour, with which the face
and the nude are painted, is thus composed. Take ceruse,
that is white which is made from lead, and put it, not ground,
but dry as it is, into a copper or iron vessel‚ and place it upon
glowing coals, and burn it until it is converted into a yellow
colour. Then grind it, and mix with it. white ceruse‚ and
cinnabar, until it is made like flesh. The mixture of these
colours may be made according to your will ; so that if you
wish to have red coloured faces, add more cinnabar3 but if
clear complexione, put more white3 if pallid however, add,
for cinnabar, a little green.

CHAPTER ΙΙ.

OF THE COLOUR CALLED PRASINUS.

Wmcn prasinus is a preparation having the appearance of a
green colour with black; such is the nature of which, that it is
not ground upon the stone, but, placed in water it is dis-
solved, and is carefully strained through a cloth3 its use is

rather advantageous upon a new wall for a green colour.
