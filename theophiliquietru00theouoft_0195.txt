CHAPTER VI.

How GLASS TABLETS ABE MADE.

ΙΝ the morning, however, at the first hour, take the iron tube,
and, if you wish to make plates of glass, place the end off it

v in a vase fullos glass; when it has adhered to it, turn this

tube round in your hand until as much as you may wish has
accumulated around it; then, withdrawing it, bring it to your
mouth and blow slightly, and instantly removing it from the
mouth, hold it near your cheek, unless, in drawing breath,
you may by chance attract the flame into your mouth. Have
also a flat stone before the window upon which you beat this
glowing glass a little, that it may hang equally on every side,
immediately and with quickness, repeatedly blowing‚ so often
you remove it from the mouth. When you see it look like a
long bladder, bring the end of it towards the flame, and,
being instantly melted, an opening will appear, and, the piece
of wood fitted for this work being taken, make the opening
as wide as is the glass in the middle. Then join its mouth
together, namely‚ the upper to the lower part, so that on both
sides of the junction an opening may appear. Instantly
touch this glass near the tube with a moist piece of wood,
shake it a little, and it will be separated. Presently also heat
the tube in the flame of the furnace, until the glass attached to
it liquefy, and, with rapidity, place it upon the two conjoined
borders of glass, and it will adhere; directly taking this up,
put it into the flame of the furnace until the opening, whence
you formerly separated the tube, is liquefied‚ and the round
piece of wood being taken, dilate it as the other, and folding
together its mouth in the middle and separating it from the
pipe with the moist wood, give it to the boy, who, introducing
a piece of wood through the opening, will carry it to the
cooling oven, which is made moderately warm. This kind of
glass is pure and white. In the same manner, and at the
same time, make similar pieces of glass until you exhaust the
vases.
