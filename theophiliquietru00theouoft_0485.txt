main. Therefore, as often as you wish to make your red
brisil, which is accustomed to become discoloured and to
thicken‚ put in some alum, and so it will be improved and,
when become thick with the glaire, will often be renewed.

If you mix white with brisil it will make a rose colour. If
you mix blue, it will make purple.

OF SINOPER.

Yon grind sinoper in the same manner as vermilion. You
can mix a little white with that, and it will be a rosy colour.
Also if you mix a little sinoper with white it will be a car-

the orpiment being overcome, it will be a red colour.

leave it until, after two or three days, it has become ma-
tured. But should it be too clear, place it where it can be-
come thick, not in the sun, however, and so it will be im—
proved. Also put the shred of brisil, very fine, into strong
“ glaire, and after two or three (days) it will become matured.
You can likewise temper woad a second or third time, but
beware that it do not become quite dry. Grind blue earth
upon a stone with water, stirring it with the finger and apply-
ing water, that it may pass through a cloth, afterwards strain
it through a delicate eloth, that it may be cleaner. This being
purified ,and dried, put to it some strong glaire3 afterwards
take yolk of fresh egg and mix it with water and wine in equal
parts, and put very little into the colour, and it will make it
