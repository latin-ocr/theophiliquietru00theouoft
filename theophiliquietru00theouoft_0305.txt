with the compass, and portray with a blunted graver the
likeness of a lamb in the middle, or a right hand as if de-
scending from heaven and blessing, and letters between these
two circles, and hollow it finely with the sculpturing iron,
polishing it effectively, as the chalice.

CHAPTER XXVII.

OF THE LARGER OHALIOE AND lTS MOULD.

ΒΗΤ if you wish to construet a large silver chalice, of four, or
six, or ten marks, you will first purify and prove all the silvei·
in the fire; afterwards divide it in the order above. After this
take two pieces of iron equally long and wide, of the measure
of a palm and thick as a straw, evenly beaten and without
flaw, and carefully smoothed with a plane: make between
these an iron binding beaten smoothly and moderately
thick, which you will bend in fashion of a circle, of such size
as it may be apparent to you that it can be filled with the
silver which you wish to cast in it. And when you have bent
it, do not join the ends together, but you will separate them
a little that an opening may appear through which you can
pour in. You will adapt this circle equally between the two
iron (plates), so that its ends may appear a little beyond the
irons, and bind these with three strong iron hooks in three
places, namely‚ below and on each side near the opening, and
thus plaster beaten clay around the circle between the irons
and abundantly about the opening. When this mould has
become dry, you warm it and pour in the melted silver, All
gold and silver, which is founded in this manner, is always
sound ,(unless it happen through great negligence, ) for working
in it whatever you may wish. You will measure the circles
also according to the quantity which you wish to found, and
you make larger and smaller: after you have beaten out the
melted silvei· as above, fill it with wax and beat it on the
body, if you wish to have ribs flat or round3 these stand
around like small spoons, both which kinds of work give

great ornament to the chalice.
