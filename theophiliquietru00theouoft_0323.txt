it with quicksilver until it is made white, that you may be able
to gild with it. Afterwards make the composition for reviving
and gilding in this manner.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

OF REVIVING AND GILDING THE HANDLEs.

TAKE the wine-stone, of which we have before spoken, and
grind it carefully upon a dry stone, and add to it a third part
salt, and put it into a large vase of clay, and pouring upon it
that water into which you have thrown the recently milled
gold, and putting to it a little quicksilver, place it upon the
coals until it is made hot, and stir it with wood. Have also
(a brush of) hog's bristles of the thickness of three or f0ur
fingers, bound together with iron in the middle3 you clean
both ends, with which you will wash the gold and silver,
and (have) two with which you will gild, one dry, the

silver handles in your hand, and dip a small linen cloth, folded,
into the hot preparation, with which you will rub all the
places which you may wish to gild in them. And when you
wish to revive them, warm them over the coals, and with the
brushes moistened with the same preparation, rub them strongly,
until all the hollows are made white with the quicksilver,
sometimes warming and sometimes rubbingÍ¾ and where you
cannot reach with the brushes, you will rub with the brass
gilder and the slender wood, doing this over a wooden gilding
dish, which may be turned for a small work, and capacious
and square and hollow and flat for a large work. Then over
this dish cut the gilding (preparation) very small with a
knife, and lay it carefully over all with the copper gilder, and
smooth it with the moistened brushes3 and with the long and
thin tongs, enveloped at the extremity by two small pieces of
linen, you will raise it, and place it over the coals until it is
made hot, and you will again smooth it with the brushes, and
