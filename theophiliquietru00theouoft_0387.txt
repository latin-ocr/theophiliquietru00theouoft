CHAPTER LXIX.

How GOLD IS SEPARATED FROM COPPER.

BUT if at any time you have broken copper or silver gilt ves-
sels, or any other work, you can in this manner separate the
gold. Take the bones of whatever animal you please, which
(bones) you may have found in the street, and burn them,
being cold, grind them finely‚ and mix with them a third part
of beech-wood ashes, and make cups as we have mentioned
above in the purification of silver3 you will· dry these at the
fire or in the sun. Then you carefully serape the gold from
the copper, and you will fold this scraping in lead beaten
thin, and one of these cups being placed in the embers before
the furnace, and now become warm, you place in this fold of
lead with the seraping, and coals being heaped upon it you
will blow it. And when it has become melted, in the same
manner as silver is accustomed to be purified, sometimes by
removing the embers and by adding lead, sometimes by re-
cooking and warily blowing, you burn it, until, the copper
being entirely absorbed, the gold may appear pure.

How 'GOLD IS SEPARATED FRoM SILvER.

WHEN you have scraped the gold from sssver, place this
scraping in a small cup in which gold or silver is accustomed
to be melted, and press a small linen cloth upon it, that no-
thing may by chance be abstracted from it by the wind of the
bellows, and placing it before the furnace, melt it; and
directly lay fragments of sulphur in it, according to the quan-
t'ity of the scraping, and carefully stir it with a thin piece of
charcoal until its fumes cease3 and immediately pour it into
an iron mould. Then gently beat it upon the auvil, lest by
chance some of that black-may fly from it which the sulphur
