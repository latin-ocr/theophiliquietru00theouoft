TRANSLATION. 41

summer with water, in winter without water, and when it is
clear, put the minium into a horn and pour the clear upon it,
and stir it a little with a piece of wood put into it, and with a
pencil fill up all places with it upon which you wish to lay gold.
Then place a little pot with glue over the fire, and when it is
quuefied, pour it into the shell of gold and wash it with it.
When you have poured which into another shell, in which the
purifying is kept, again pour in warm glue, and holding it in
the palm of the left hand, stir it carefully with the pencil, and
lay it on where you wish thick or thin, so however that there
be little glue, because, should it exceed, it blackens the gold
and does not receive a polish. But after it has dried, polish
it with a tooth or bloodstone carefully filed and polished,
upon a smooth and shining horn tablet. But should it happen,
through negligence of the glue not being well cooked, that
the gold pulverises in rubbing, or rises on account of too

great thickness, have near you some old clear of egg beat up “

without water, and directly with a pencil paint slightly and
quickly with it over the gold3 when it is dry, again rub it with
the tooth or stone. Lay in this manner silver, brass, and
copper in their place, and polish them.

CHAPTER XXXII.

How A PICTURE IS ORNAMENTED IN Booxs WITH TIN
ΛΝΒ SAFFRON.

ΒΗΤ if you have neither of these, and 'yet wish to decorate
your work in some manner, take tin pure and finely scraped ;
mill it and wash it like gold, and apply it with the same glue,
upon letters or other places which you wish to ornament with
gold or silver: and when you have polished it with a tooth‚
, take saffron, with which silk is coloured, moistening it with
clear of egg without water, and when it has stood a night, on
the following day cover with a pencil the places which you
wish to gild, the rest holding the place of silver. Then make
fine traits round letters and leaves and flourishes from minium,
with a pen, also the stuffs of dresses and other ornaments.
