glass vase, and again pour wine over the sediment, and place
it again in the above mentioned place, and they do this the
whole year, adding a portion of green. Those, however,
who wish to procure it sooner, grind this green with wine
as directed above, and then it is used for writing as vermilion,
or azure, it is ground with wine3 you then take the best wine
and put it into any brass or copper vessel, and you boil it.
This being cooked and cleansed from froth, keep it and
temper the green colour with it and place it in the warmth of
the sun, or a slow fire, until it has become moderately thick,
and putting yellow and the powder of calcined bones into it,
it contracts yet more, and better, green 3 or if you mix new
with the old, it will possess another green colour3 should it
have become quite or nearly dry, add a little water. More-

this having settled, take the liquid portion and put it in the
mild sunshine‚ or in a place where it can become inspissated.
When it has become fit for painting, place it in a copper οι·
brass vessel, and you can keep it good for a long time.
Should it become darker, put to it a little saffron or powder
of calcined bones. Should you wish to illuminate more
speedily, take the yolk of a fresh egg and mix mead or wine
with the green, and with this liquor grind the green upon a
stone, and temper with it, and it will thus be good.

OF BRISIL WOOD.

Bmsn, wood is scraped with a knife into a vase, and white of
egg is poured over it. This being done, and after it has com-
menced to mature, alum is put into it, about the proper
measure3 after this brisil has become matured the liquor is
withdrawn and kept in another vessel. This done, glaire
is again to be placed upon the same brisil, and it is to be
withdrawn after it has become matured. This is done as long
as the brisil shall colour the glaire ε beware of this, however,
that you do not temper brisil without alum, otherwise all the
brisil fades from the parchment, and the glaire alone will re-
