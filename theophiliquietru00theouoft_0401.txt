TRANsLATIoN. 331

borders slender and wide, in which can be flowers, animals
and small birds, or dragons linked together by the necks and
tails, and they are not sculptured too deeply, but moderately
and carefully. You will then thin silver‚ much more thinly
than for the relief, of the length you wish, and you will
cleanse it with charcoal‚ finely pulverized, and a cloth3 you
polish it with chalk scraped upon it.

Which being done, affix the silver to any border, and the
iron being placed upon an anvil, so that the engraving may
be uppermost, and the silver lying upon it, place above it
some thick lead and strike strongly with the hammer, so that
the lead may beat upon the thin silver‚ into the sculpture, so
strongly, that all the designs may fully appear in it. But
should the plate be longer (than the stamp) draw it from place
to place, and, affixed to the iron‚ hold it evenly with the pin-
cers, and one part being struck, another can be hammered,
and do thus until all the plate be filled up. This kind of
work is rather useful, about the borders, in manufacturing
the tables of altars, in pulpits‚ in caskets for sacred sub-
stances, and in whatever places needful 3 and when the relies
is beautiful and delicate, it is easily done. Work of this kind
is also made in copper, which is thinned in a similar manner,
is cleansed and gilt and polished3 this placed upon the iron‚
so that the gilding be turned towards the iron‚ the lead being
superposed, it is struck until the designs appear. The image
of the crucifixion of the Lord is also sculptured in iron‚ in the
above mentioned manner, of which, when impressed upon
silver or copper, phylacteria are made, that is, coffers of relies
and small shrines of saints. A sculpture is also made in iron
of the image of the Lamb of God, and the figures of the four
evangelists, with which, impressed upon gold or silver‚ the
cups of precious wood are ornamented, the circle of the lamb
standing in the middle of the cup, the four evangelists in
fashion of a cross around, and with four borders proceeding
from the lamb to the four evangelists3 figures of small fish
and of birds and beasts are made, which are fixed upon the
remaining ground of the cup, affording much ornament.
The image of the Divinity is also made in the same manner,
