cinders, carefully pour in. The two moulds being in this
manner founded, allow them to remain until the funnel above
grow black; then, the earth being removed, taking them from
the trough‚ place them in a safe place until they grow quite
cold, above all things taking care that you cast no water over
the hot moulds‚ because the nuclei which are inside are in-
stantly swelled if they feel humidity‚ and all the work is burst
asunder. When they have cooled by themselves you remove
the clay, and carefully examine them3 and if anything be de·
ficient through negligence or casualty, filing about that place
you will thin it, and wax being applied and the clay added,
when dry you warm it, and thus found over it, until that
which you pour over adhere, the jet flowing over the p'lace.
When you have examined this, should it be insecure, you will
solder it with the burnt wine stone and the filing from the
mixture of silver and copper, as we have before prescribed. ’
After this, with different files, square, triangular, and round,
you will first file across all the surfaces. You then sculp
them with the sculping instruments, and serape them with
the serapers; at last, the work being cleansed everywhere
with sand with wood slightly crushed at the end, you will
gild it.

IN making the chains, first first draw out very fine, or thicker,
wires in copper or silver, and bend them with the bodkin into
three, or four, or five, οι· six ears, according to the breadth you
may wish, to the proportion of each large or small censer.
And when you have bent all the chains of one censer in one
piece take a thin wood of oak or beech, and make numerous
holes in it with a pointed iron instrument, round and hot;
through these holes you draw the chain, cooked in the fire
and again cooled, and you again cook it ; again you draw it
through another hole and re—cook it, and you act thus until it
is equally thick and round. Then cut this· chain into pieces,
