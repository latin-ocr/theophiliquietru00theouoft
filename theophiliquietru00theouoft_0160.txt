at the time of our passage, had just been built; it was scaffolded
for receiving the fresco paintings at the upper part of the vault.
Workmen, under the direction of the painters, prepared in the
court the mixed lime which was to serve as the plaster. As two
plasterings are made, there are two kinds of lime; the first, a kind
of mortar rather fine, is mixed with straw cut small, which gives it
a yellow colour; in the second, which is of a finer quality, they
mix cotton or flax. Itis with the lime of a yellow colour that
they make the first plastering3 it adheres to the wall better than the
second. The second is white, fine, and makes a rather firm paste,
by means of the cott0n3 it is this which receives the painting.

fi “ The workmen then bring the yellow lime and apply upon the
wall a layer of the thickness of about half a centimetrel. Upon
this layer, some hours afterwards they spread a pellicle of the fine
and white lime. This second operation demands more care than
the first, and I have seen the brother of the painter Joasaph, a
painter himself, apply this second couch of lime. ΤΗΕΥ wmr

before that time, the lime would soil the colours3 afterwards, the
painting would not be solid, and would not enter into the mortar,
which would be too hard, too dry to absorb the colours. It need
not be said that the thermometrical state of the atmosphere
abridges or lengthens the interval which must be allowed to leave .
the plaster to dry suitably before painting.

“Before drawing, the master painter smooths the lime with a
spatula3 then, by means of a string, he determines the size which
his picture should have. Within this picture, on the ground of his
figures, he measures with a compass the dimensions which the dif-
ferent objects, which he wishes to represent, will have. The com-
pass which Father Joasaph used was simply a cane bent double,
divided in the middle, and adjusted by a piece of wood, which
united the two branches and brought them together or parted them
at pleasure. One of the branches was sharpened to a point, the
other was furnished with a small brush, (pinceau.) A compass of
a more simple, commodious, or economical fashion could not be
made.
