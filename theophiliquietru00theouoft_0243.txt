‘⁶ The calcination of tartar of red and white wine is thus made.
Wash hard tartar often in water, and place it to be calcined in a
reverberatory furnace, with little‘fire at first 3 augment it afterwards
until it grows white inside. Then cast it into hot water in a clean
vessel, and dissolve it with a clean spatula, and when it has become
dissolved, allow it to cool. Afterwards pass it through a filter‚ then
bear it upon the fire and inspissate that which is strained, and after-
wards grind it and put it into an uncovered pot to caleine, until the
pot is red hot, for one hour, perhaps; afterwards extract and grind
and dissolve it in hot water and expose it to cool3 afterwards
filter and evaporate, again calcine it as before another hour3 dis-
solve, evaporate, and calcine it: when it runs upon a plate or the
furnace without fume it is then proper for melting crystal.”

‘⁶ THE METHOD oF MELTING GLASS Is 011ch AND EASY.”

‘⁴ Take clear crystal, as much as you please, and in large stenes,
so that it may be vthe size of a hen’s egg, or half, and place these
pieces in a brass or iron vessel, extra-luted‚ in a coal fire, and
when they shall become glowing, quench these stones of crystal in
good oil of tartar, (in oleo bono tartari ¹‚) white and pure, and
do the like seven, or more, times3 afterwards grind it very fine in
a mortar, and pulverize it well and sift it; afterwards put the
“ powder into an iron pot, (caryfia‚) and place it upon a coal fire3 it
is then quickly and easily melted. Know that when the crystal is
soft over the fire, you should throw oil of tartar into it drop by
drop, and it will be easily melted; and when it has become fused
cast it upon plates ofiron.”

“Take crystal very finely powdered and calcined, l part: sal

glass furnace, and when fused add the colours mentioned below.''
