TRANSLATION. 351

for yourself an iron which may have a round head, like an
egg, and a long thin stem, which is fitted with a handle, and
let it be slightly curved, near the head, with which, made hot,
you burn the holes curved inside, until they meet together in
an even manner. Which being done, cut this wood in a square
manner, set so that it be one palm wide in each side, to the size
of the wind-chamber in the blunt part. After these things join
this wood on the longer part, to the lower opening of the organ
construction, so that a projection may be cut to the same
wood a thumb in length, which can be placed, or forced into
this opening, and that the join be so subtle that no wind can
escape from it. You join on in the same manner the other
end to the bellows, and will fasten this wood with cheese
glue, and will wrap round the whole wood, with the join,
with cloth, to which you also fix a wide piece of copper which
may also compass the edge of each wood. These things
being thus completed, should you wish to establish the organ
beyond the masonry of the wall, so that nothing may appear
beneath the cloister‚ unless the erection alone with the
pipes, and that the bellows may extend from the other side,
you must so turn the construction that the stops may be
drawn out towards the bellows, and an arch may be made in
the wall itself in which the chanter can sit, whose seat is so
adapted that he can keep his feet above the bellows. There
is also a square opening in the middle of the arch through
the masonry, through which the construction with the pipes
is laid out3 and upon the neck of the bellows which is in the
wall, beneath, the opening is made firm with stones, it is sup-
ported at its junction, and is rested upon two long iron nails
evenly fixed in the wall; to this opening a wooden window
hangs, which, when shut, is defended by a lock and key, that
no stranger coming unawares be able to learn what may be
contained in it. Outside also, above the organ, a thick
drapery, extended inside with wood like a dome, for warding
off the dust, can hang by a rope from the ceiling‚ which rope
arranged with art around a wheel above the ceiling itself, is
drawn whilst the organ is sounding, and thus raises the roof,
and the chant being finished, it is lowered upon the organ.
