TRANSLATION. 423

OF MAKING THE BEST AZURE.

TAKE a new pot and place leaves of the purest silver in it, as
many as you please‚ and place this pot in the grape pressings
which are thrown from the press or vat, and cover the pot
with layers of this grape refuse and keep it carefully until the
fifteenth day, and so open the pot, and serape whatever has
dried upon the leaves into a very clean vessel. Should you
wish for more, act again in a similar manner.

OF MAKING OTHER AZURE.

TAKE a small vase of the purest copper and fill it with the
strongest vinegar, and cover its mouth carefully‚ lest any
humidity or vapour may escape, adding to this, should it be
necessary, a tenacious earth, or lute3 and place this jar thus
closed in some 'warm place, or in the ground, or in the litter
thrown from the stable‚ and so leave it for one month, and
then open this jar and expose what you may have found in it
to dry, in the sun.

FINIS.
