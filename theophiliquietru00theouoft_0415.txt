be carried round and the pipe remain still, until it appear
elegant to the eyes, as if turned. The iron being then
taken out, the pipe is struck slightly with the hammer near
the opening, above and below, so that this round shape may
depress almost to the centre for a space of two fingers 3 the
valve may be made from copper somewhat thicker, like a
half wheel‚ and be soldered over about the round part, as
the pipe above, and be so placed in the lower part of the
opening that its edge may stand equally under it, nor pro-
trude below or above. He can have also a soldering iron of
the same breadth and roundness as is the valve. With this,
heated, he can place small particles of tin upon the valve,
and a little resin, and can carefully pass over the hot iron
that he may not move the valve, but that the tin being melted
it may so adhere that no wind can come out in its circum-
ference‚ unless only into the upper opening. Which being done
he can bring it to his mouth and blow at first slightly, then
more, and then strongly; and according to what he discerns
by hearing, he can arrange the sound, so that if he wish it
strong, the opening is made wider 3 if slighter, however, it is
made narrower. In this order all the pipes are made3 he can
make the measure of each, from the valve upwards, according
to the rule inculcated, but from the valve below, all will be of
one measure and of the same thickness ¹.

 

CHAPTER LXXXII.

OF THE ORGAN ERECTION.

IN the manufacture of the construction, upon which the pipes
are to stand, see whether you intend to have it of wood or
copper. If of wood, procure for yourself two pieces of wood
of the plane tree, very dry, two feet and a half in length, and
in breadth rather more than one3 one four, the other two
fingers thick, which must not be knotty, but without blemish.
Which being carefully joined together, in the lower part of
