and not too slender, but middling. After this make for your-
self a thin iron half a foot in length, which must be rather
wide at one extremityâ€š to the size of your nail, and slightly
hollow, and the other end can be fixed to a wooden handle.
Then sitting near the furnace proper for this work, before
which a small copper vessel with melted wax can stand, and
in the left hand holding the handle of this thin iron, made hot
in the wider part, and in the right the tin wire, the extremity
of which rolled like a ball, you moisten in the melted wart,
and placing it upon one of the flowers in that part where the
tin is, so that it may adhere, you will raise it, and you place

it in the hollow of the heated iron and will hold it until it ,-

liquefy, and you will instantly remove both from the fire and
you cut the wire with the forceps according to the length
which you wish the stem of the nail to possess. And you do
thus until you expend, in nails of this kind, that silver and
gilt copper. And when you have an abundance of nails, and
may wish to fix them upon the stirrup leathers of a horse-
saddle, or about the head-piece of a bridle, first make holes
with the awl, and so place the nails in order, so that three
may be golden and three silver, and again three gold, and
similarly throughout. But should you wish to have two or
three rows, always place one silver and the other golden
throughout, and so placing the strap with the heads upon a
smooth wooden table, fasten on the stems with a middle sized
hammer. Nails are also made by the same workmanship
from brass, but thicker, the copper stems of which are sol-
dered inside with pure tin in the same manner. With these
the sheaths of knives are fixed, and leathers upon books, and
many things of this kind.
