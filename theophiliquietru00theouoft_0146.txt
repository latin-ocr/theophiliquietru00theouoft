conjecture. M. de L’Escalopier prefers the former hypothesis, as
he has translated the word “ atramentum'' into “noir”—black;
it will be seen that I have preferred the latter in the presence of
the bark juice, or tannic aeid. .

Another atramentum, the “ atramentum sutorium” of the
Romans, or “sulphate of copper,” blue vitriol, is certainly not
intended.

Inmcum, c. 14. Both Vitruvius and Pliny¹ mention indig03
“ when divided it is black, but diluted it yields an admirable mix-
ture of purple and blue.’' Indicum was called by the Byzantine
artists‚ and others, “ Azoreum Romanum.” In a MS. of the
fourteenth century of Byzantine source2 we find “ Rorrian azure,
otherwise indigo, is ground in water. ln this Roman azure you
can mix orpiment for a yellow green. Likewise, if you add Brasil,
it will be a purple.”

In the same MS. the azures are defined.

“Azorium bonum est quod Saraceni faciunt. Item, azorium
Romanum est aliud quod Indicum vocatur.” “

John Archerius, who in A.D. 13983 wrote a treatise upon colours
from the verbal directions of J acobus Cona, a Flemish painter then
residing in Paris, calls indigo “ Bagadellus.'' This is the ‘⁶ indaco-
baccadeo” of Cennino.

The tariffs of Marseilles speak of the indigos of Bagdad, which
are called “indigo bagadel,’-’ since the year 12284.

The introduction of indigo into western Europe gradually put
an end to the culture of the isatis tinctona, pastel, or woad, which
was at one time su lucrative a branch of industry.'’ ⁵

IN LAQuEAm, c. 14. In our author this word means the orna-
menting of ceiling or plaster work. Theophilus distinguishes it
from “ in muro‚” as by caustic lime being employed in the latter,
it is rendered unfit for the reception of certain colours which “in
laqueari” can ,be applied.

The Catholicon tells us that “ Laquear’' is so called from the
