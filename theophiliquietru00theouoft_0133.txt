‘⁸ κοκκος” of the Greeks, the “ Kermes berries.” These are excres-
cences of the ilex “ cocciglandifera‚’' ‘⁴ quercus coccifera” or
scarlet oak, and were supposed to be a berry. The Greeks used them
as a red dye. The coccinos and vaccinium of the Byzantines was
from this kermes, as also the cremisi of the Italians, cramoisi,
French,and our crimson3 the “ scharlatto” of the Italians,our scarlet.

The ‘¹ yellow Saunders” wood which yielded the red colour
called “ Brixilium” by the Latins and “ Verzino” by the early
Italian artists, is the Romaic “ κοκκίνοκωλος.”

Madder likewise was a folium of the Byzantines. “ Rubea
radix” est, de qua rubeus color fit miscendo cum creta alba, id est
gypso.’'—Tab. Voc. Syn.

This was the ‘⁶ Verantia’' or “ Alithina’' of the ByzantineS, the
“ true red,” τὰ ἀληθινὰ fiairi-721, Myrepsus ¹.

St. Audemar speaks of madder as ‘⁶ Warrantia” in the Le Begue
MS. Art. 183.

Ι give a recipe from a MS. of the fourteenth century which will
show the means employed to extract the colour from madder in our
country at that time.

For to make a fyne rede. Take woode-ashys and seeth thern in

clere water awhile, as hot as you might soffer thyne hand, then ν

cast there in madyr and the white osan eg and bole 6 worthe thereto‚
and hit will be as rede as scarlet. And sor to make more, suffyceth,
take comyn ashys and unguant them and make lye thereof, then
temper with water as thou wilt have it thynner or thyckker ². ,
Neither Eraclius nor Cennini speak of madder. The MS. from

Mount Athos gives directions for making a vegetable red only
from kermes ³.

My reason for not concurring in the opinion of Merrimee and
the French writers, that copal was the resin intended by Theophi-
lus, was a conviction, subsequently verified by comparison and
experiment, that copal would neither answer to the description
given, nor to the treatment proposed by Theophilus in the com-
position of his varnish.

At the conclusion of Merrimee’s⁴ chapter upon copal varnish
