THE LOST CHAPTERS.

Chapters xii„ xiii„ xiv„ xv„ of the Harleian Manuscript‚
are wanting. They have evidently never formed a part of
this manuscript, as the chapter which forms our No. xii„ ‘⁶ DE
D1vmzs1s Vrrm Conomnus Non TRANSLUCIDIS,” is marked No.
xvi. in the index, and yet is a consecutive chapter in the body of
the work. They have been abstracted from the original manu-

script, now lost, as it is seen els'ewhere that the oldest copy of
Theophilus known, that in the Imperial Library at Vienna, also
wants them, as do the Wolfenbiittel and Nani MSS. Having the
titles of these chapters in the index it will perhaps be possible to
replace this lacuna with the matter, if not in the words of Theo-
philus, by consulting the preceding or cotemporaneous Byzantine
works, in which this subject is discussed.

C. xii. “ Of the colours which are made from Copper, Lead, and
Salt.'’—c. xiii. “Of Green Glass.”—c. xiv. “Of Blue Glass.’'--
c. xv. “ Of the glass called Gallien.'' These are the titles of the
missing chapters, and they unfortunately leave a great void in the
history of the art of the period at which Theophilus wrote. It is
not to be doubted that, notwithstanding the resources of the
modern artificer in the advances and the aid of science, some of
the compositions‚ of material, of the ancients are in vain sought in
our day, although a portion of our glass painters refuse to acknow-
ledge the fact. Where is to be seen in the atelier of to-day the
finest and peculiar “blue '’ traceable until the end of the fifteenth
century? Cobalt will not produce this colour3 or if 80, of what use
is our vaunted advance in chemical science, if it yet remains a pro-
blem? Should one novelty be produced from the perusal of the
following extracts, they will have been found worthy the perusal
of the artist, and they will repay the labour of research.

OF GREEN GLASS.

olympiodorus of Alexandria, who wrote at the commencement
of the third century, and a manuscript of whom upon the “ sacred
art ” of alchemy is in the Bibliotheque Royale at Paris, No. 2250,

gives us the mode of imitating the emerald.
