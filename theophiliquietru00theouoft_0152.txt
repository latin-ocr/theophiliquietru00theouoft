orpiment. Again, in the imitation of the rainb0w‚ c. 16, manisc,
as a violet colour, is conjoined with cinnabar and with yellow,
both of which it would carry out ; in the same chapter directions
are given to shade manisc with folium, a little black being added
at the extremity. It is evident that it isa tendet colour, as veneda
is directed to be first laid on if used upon walls, and the word ap-
pears to imply that class of colours possessing a violet tint rather
than indicative of any particular substance. I have found receipts
for the manufacture of a bluish or violet colour from the petals
of the violet flower, which would be little permanent, and which
has probably, as woad, disappeared after the introduction of
indigo.

Murum, c. 14. Itis remarkable that although Theophrastus has
accurately described the miltos and cinnabar of the> Greeks, he
has made no mention of minium or the “ red oxide of lead.’'

A great confusion of terms has unfortunately occurred amongst
the ancient writers with respect to minium, and numerous errors
have arisen from the reproduction of these inaccuracies. The
minium of the Romans was sometimes our “ vermilion,” or
“sulphuret of mercury,” sometimes our “minium,’' or “prot-
oxide of lead,’' sometimes the “ red ochres,” as the “minium
sinopium '’ of Pliny.

Dioscorides ¹ signalises this error. “ Some erroneously believe
that minium is identical with cinnabar,'’ &c. The minium of
Dioscorides was produced from a galena. “ For-² minium is made
from an argentiferous stone mixed with sandst'· Was this the
“artificial cinnabar’' of Theophrastus invented by Callias the
Athenian in the reign of Praxibulus, only ninety years before his
time ³? This would account for the confusion of terms.

The “ minium ’' manufactured from cerussa is called “ sandyx ”
by Dioscorides, L. 5, c. 57. This term for minium was adopted
afterwards in Italy, as Hieron. Cardanus says that minium was
also called “ sandyx,” and that “ sandix ’³ was a term also applied to
burnt ochre ; and in the much quoted line of Virgil,

“ Sponte sua sandyx pascentes vestiet agnos,”
This latter colour would seem to be intended, rather than
