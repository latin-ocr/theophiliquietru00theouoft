can beat and thiu it with a long and slender hammer, if need-
sul. But if two or three, or more, heads should be in the
picture, you should do about each one as I have said, until
the height which you may wish is attained. Then with
the tracing instrument design the body or bodies of the
figures, and so, by depressing and sometimes by beating, you
will relieve them as much as it may please y0u3 providing
this, however, that the head be always the most relieved.
After these things you will design the nostrils and eyebrows,
the mouth and ears, the hair, eyes, hands and arms, and the
other shadows of the draperies, the footstools and feet, and
you will raise them inside thus, with the smallest curved in-
struments, above all taking care that it be not broken or per·
forated. But if through wantos knowledge, or negligence,
this should happen, it should be soldered in this manner.
Take a little of the gold itself, or silver, and mix with it a third
part of copper, and melting them together you will file it
finely, and wine-stone being burnt and salt added, you will
mix it with water3 thinly anointing it with which, spread
the filing over the fracture. This dry, again anoint the mix-
ture, more thickly, and coals being applied above and below,
you will blow gently‚ until you can see the solder flow. See-
ing which, immediately sprinkle it with water, and if it be
hard, well; if not, however, do the like again until it has be-
come firm. should the fracture, however, be broad, carefully
join a small piece of the same gold or silver, equally thin, to
it, which you will solder in the like manner until it adhere
everywhere. And when the relies of the figures shall have
been carried to the point of the chasings, should it be gold,
you immediately make them, and polish carefully, and you
will colour it with “ atrament,⁷' ¹ burnt to redneSS, and salt,
as above in the work of the chalice. Should, however, the
picture be silver, and you should wish upon these figures to
gild the crowns, the hair, beard and portions of the draperies,
this should be done before the fine lines are made, in this
manner. Ari-ange two parts only of clay, finely ground, and
a third of salt, and mix them together in a small vessel with
