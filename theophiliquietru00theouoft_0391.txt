When a plate has been carefully scraped, you will imme—
diately revive it with the mixture of wine—stone and quick-

the gilding in water, but it will become cool by itself, you

manner.

CHAPTER LXXII.

OF PIERCED WORK.

TmN out plates from the same copper as above, but thicker3
these being designed, sculp whatever work you may wish,
as above. You then have thin and wide instruments, ac-
cording to the size of the grounds, which must be at one ex·-
tremity thin and sharp, at the other blunt, which are called
meizil; and placing the plate upon the anvil, you will per-
forate all the grounds with the above mentioned instruments,
striking with the hammer. And when all the grounds have
been· perforated in such manner, you will smooth them all
over with very small files down to the designs. Which being
done you will gild it, and you polish the plate as above.
Tablets are made in the same manner, and silver plates upon
books, with figures, flowers, animals and birds, of which a part
is gilt, namely the crowns of figures, and hair, and garments,
in places, and part remains silver. Copper plates are also
made, and they are carved and blackened and scraped3 they
are then placed in a vessel with melted tin, that the scrapings
may become white, as if they were silvered. With these,
painted chairs and seats, and beds are bound, the books os
the poor are also (thus) ornamented.
