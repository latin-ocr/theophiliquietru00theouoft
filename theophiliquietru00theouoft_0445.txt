CHAPTER LXXXVIII.

How TIN IS SOLDERED.

ΒΕΑΤ, from tin two cups, alike, and join them together in the
middle, so that the rim of one may pass into the other, and
that which contains the other being placed upon hot ashes,
beat very thinly a piece of the same tin mixed with a third
part of lead, and cutting it up very small, lay it around (the
join); and a few ignited coals being applied, as soon as it has
glowed, anoint it round with resin of the fir-tree, and you
will instantly see these particles melt and flow about. The
coals being directly removed, when cold‚ it will be firm. In
this manner, whatever work is in pure tin may be soldered,
namely, the spouts and handles in vials, and the fastenings in
which the covers hang, also should any hole have happened
through negligence in the cast vial.

CHAPTER LXXXIX.

OF CASTING THE SPOUT.

THE spout can also thus be easily formed ; a piece of cleft wood Ι
is cut round, and is bored with the auger lengthwise, not quite
to the end, and it is split through the middle3 and in its whole
part a hole is made to which a circular iron, according to the
capacity of the interior of the spout, overlaid with thin clay,
is inserted, and it is well bound round outside, and tin, it
being made warm, is poured in. Which being cold, the wood
is loosened, and the iron taken out, and the spout being filed
and smoothed in the above mentioned manner, is fastened on
to the vase.
