with oil: Pliny concludes his notice of the resins by the statement
that every resin is dissolved in oil. ‘⁴ Resina omnis dissolvitur in
oleo; ” the word ‘⁴ coquenti ” is thus explained.

Sandarac was called “ sandaracha Arabum,” during the middle
ageS‚ by most of the writers on physics3 one example will suffice.
Caneparius “de atramentis ’' ¹ writes, “ De vernice, qua effingun-
tur coria aurata. Cape oleum lini ad pondus librarum trium,
vernicis, vulgo appellatur sandaracha Arabum, libra una‚” &c.‚ διο.
Andrea Alpagus2 calls sandarac “ sanderosj’ and adds ‘⁶ est
almedon‚ et est vernix quae dicitur sandaracfiha

In a manuscript belonging to the Royal Library at Μ ontpellier, of
the early part of the fifteenth century, and which is principally a
collection of authors upon medical subjects‚ is a small treatise upon
the arts. This MS. was kindly placed at my disposal by M. Libri,
of the Sorbonne, Paris ³.

From this MS. I give some extracts which will show what the
“ fornis ” οι· “ glassa '‘ was.

⁴ “thrpx'r LIBER DIVERSARUM AR'rmM.

“ De glutine vernicon.

“Pone oleum lini in ollam novam parvam, adde gummi quod
vocatur fernix vel grassa, minutissime tritum, et assimilatur thuri:
deinde Ponatur ad lentum ignem et coquatur, ita ut non bulliat,
usque dum tertia pars consumatur, omnino et caveatur ab igne,
quod multum periculosum est, et de levi non extinguitur.”

“ Ad vernicem.

“ Accipe gLassa, vel fernix grana, estque idem quod vernix, et
fac eam lente liquare, et bullito oleo linosae, insimul misce, com-
mixtum ita tractu, dimitte bene coopertum donec frigescat.”

It will be seen that these are, in substance, the two chapters ofour
author, that the “ fernix,’' ‘⁴ grassa,'’ “glassa,’' and “vernix ‘’ are
synonymous, and explain Theophilus. “ Grassa ’⁵ is the Moorish
and a Spanish term for sandarac: the substitution of the r for l,
is common also with the Neapolitan and Roman people.
