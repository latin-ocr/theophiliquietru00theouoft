CHAPTER XLIX.

OF GOLD SAND.

Tnmm is another gold, which is called sandy (gold), which
is found upon the banks of the Rhine in this manner. The
sands are dug up in those places where there is expectation

frequently and carefully poured upon them, and, the sand
flowing away, a very fine gold remains‚ which is replaced in
a small vessel separately. And when the vase is half full,
quicksilver is placed in and it is rubbed strongly with the
hand until it is quite mixed together, and thus placed in a
fine cloth, the quicksilver is squeezed from it; but what re-

prove separate pieces of gold, if they can be beaten with the
hammer without breaking, and what is not broken place by

cooked. Tben take a piece of burnt brick, and according to
the quantity of gold carve a hollow in it, which can contain
it; and if you have not brick, a hollow being made in a
sandy and square stone, place it in the fire and blow upon it.
And when it has become hot, place in the gold, and coals
being laid upon it blow for a very long time, and being taken

for it: if however it is broken, replace it upon another stone,
