THE BEGINNING

THE THIRD BOOK.

OF THE OONSTRUCTION OF THE WORK BUILDING.

Bmm) a spacious and lofty house for yourself‚ the length of
which must streteh towards the east ; in the southern wall of
which make as many windows as you vvish and are able, so
as five feet may exist between two windows. But separate
half of the house, for making molten work, and for working
copper‚ tin and lead, by a wall reaching to the summit ; and
again divide that part leftl into two, by one wall, for working
gold in one part, silver in the other. The windows must not
rise higher than a foot from the ground ; let their height be
three feet, their width two.

 

CHAPTER II.

OF THE SEAT OF THE WORKMEN.

Tum dig a trench before the window‚ a foot and a half from
the wall of the window‚ which (trench) will stand across,
having the length of three feet, the width of two, which you
line around with wood3 two pieces of which wood can pro-
trude from the trench, in the centre opposite the window‚ to
the height of half a foot‚ upon which a table, which may
cover the knees of those seated in the trench‚ is joined, in
breadth two feet, in length three, crosswise over the trench,
so smooth‚ that whatever particles of gold or silver may have

fallen upon it may be carefully collected.
