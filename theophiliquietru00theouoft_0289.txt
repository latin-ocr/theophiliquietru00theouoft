CHAPTER XI.

OF SCULPING INSTRUMENTS.

SCULPmG irons are also made for hollowing out in this
manner. An instrument is made from pure steel, the length
of the great finger, and as thick as a straw, but thicker in the
middle and square. One end is placed in a handle, and at
the other end one side must be filed from the upper to the
lower angle3 but the lower, which is filed slender towards the
point, is longer3 this being heated, is tempered in water.
Many larger and smaller are made after this fashion. Another
like kind is made square, but more broad and thin, and its
edge is parallel with the breadth‚ so that two angles are
above, and the two below more long and equal. In this
fashion also many large and small are made. A round and
thick iron like a straw is also made, the point of which is
filed so that the mark which it makes be round. ”

work. They make also instruments formed in the same
manner, but blunt, for polishing the work.
