xxii PREFAcE.

Another Ms. of the seventeenth century was au-
nounced by Morelli in the Nani Library at Venice, in
which Theophilus is called RUGERUS. Morelli states
that this is copied from the ancient parchment Codex
in the Imperial Library at Vienna: “ descripti ew antiquo
codice membranaceo manuscripto Azqqustissimoe Biblio-
thecce Caesareoe V indobonensztsss' M. Guichard has omit-
ted this conclusion to his quotation from Morelli, and
questions the correctness of the statement made in p.
35 (M orellz', Cod. manuscript. Lat. Bibliotlz. Nemi.) that
there were two manuscripts of Theophilus at Vienna.

Mrs. Merrifield¹ writes to me that she saw a copy of
Theophilus at Milan, made from the old Vienna Manu-
script, similar to that in the library of St. Mark at
Venice.

The copy contained by the Le Begue MS. in the
Royal Library at Paris has already been noticed. It
is a very careless transcription of the first twenty-nine
chapters of the F irst Book only, and in quantity is si-
milar to the Trinity College MS. published by Raspe,
but the appendix is wanting.

Although neither Lambecius nor other bibliographers
have noticed the Manuscripts at Vienna, and, in conse-
quence, M. Guichard suspects some error in the state-
ment of Morelli already referred to, I have been able
to ascertain‚ through the kindness of Dr. F erdinand
Wolf, of the Imperial Library‚ that the assertion of
Morelli is correct.
