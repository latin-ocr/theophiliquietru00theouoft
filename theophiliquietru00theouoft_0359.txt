CHAPTER LIX.
or THE composrron wmcn ιε CALLED TENAx.

GRIND a piece of brick or tile very small, and melt some
pitch in an earthenware pot and add a little wax. These
being melted together, mingle the powder of the tile, and
stir it strongly and pour it into water. And when it has be-
gun to grow cold, dip both hands into the water and mace—
rate it for a long time, until you can extend and draw out this
composition like a skin. You instantly melt this composition
and will fill the vial to the top⁴ And when it has become
cold, portray in the body and in the neck whatever you wish,
and taking slender ductile instruments and a small hammer,
design that which you have portrayed around it, by striking
lightly. Then give the hammer to the boy, who may sit
opposite you, and hold the vial in your left hand, and the in-
struments in your right, each one in his place; and make
the boy strike them in what mode you please, slightly or
strongly, and depress the grounds that they may become
hollow, and the work be raised. And when you have beaten
it once throughout, the vial being brought to the fire, eject the
composition, and the vial being reheated and taken from the
fire again, fill it and beat as before, and do thus until you de-
press all the grounds equally, and you fashion all the work,
so that it may appear as if cast. Above all arrange that the

silver of the vial be so thick that when you have formed the ’

work by beating, you may be able to chase, hollow, and serape
it properly with the seulping instruments. Which being ac-
complished, if you wish, make the cast handle in the same
manner as you formed the handles of the silver chalice, and
the spout where the wine is poured out; these you will fasten
with solder, made with silver and copper as above. Then
you will ornament with niello wherever you may wish, and
gild the remainder as above.

You make in the same manner gold and silver cups and
plates and boxes for placing the wafers and incense caskets3
also handles for knives and figures upon crosses and missals

in gold, or silver, or copper.
