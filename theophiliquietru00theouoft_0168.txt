98 NOTES 'ro BOOK 1.

Aurelius, has given a singular recipe for a “ drying oil’' for the &s
time in which he wrote; although not intended as such :¹

“ Oleum vetus, quantum mittendum fuerit pro modo specierum , ,
supra scriptarum, mittes in ollam novam, et calefacies leni flamma (θ’
vel potius igne, tunc mittes, sed paulatim et manu inspergen8‚
lythargyrum bene tritum, et assidue spathomela agitabis, postea
aut picem brutiam tritam mittes,”2 &c.

In describing the method of painting on wood or stone, Eraclius
directs that the wood or stone be well dried in the sun or at the
fire3 after this, white oil colour is to be painted over it two or three
times with a flat brush3 afterwards it is to be primed with the
hand or brush with a thick white oil paint ; this, when half dry, is
to be smoothed with the hand, until all is as smooth as glass: he
adds, “ you can then paint upon it with all colours distempered with
οῐῙ,” “ tunc vero desuper poteris de omnibus coloribus et cum oleo
distemperatis pingere.” Nothing can be clearer than this ; and
that pictorial or other ornamental work is intended, is evident, for
he follows with a direction for ‘⁶ marbling‚'’ “ if you prefer it ; ” the
whole afterwards to be varnished in the sun.

Theophilus, however, who professes to teach “ all that Gree07

      

knew in the art of painting,’' ends all doubt upon the subject of the
employment of “ oil colours” for pictures in his twenty-sixth
chapter. Upon avarnished ground of tin leaf fixed upon wood he l
directs———“ Take the colours -which you wish to lay on, grinding i
them carefully in linseed oil, without water, and make the tints of ¹ ¹ ·
countenances and draperies, as you have done above, with water-3 Ῑ
and you will vary with their colours beasts, birds, or leaves, as it ξ · ἒ
may please you. '' The reluctance to part with a long received ι XQ' .
impression must therefore be set aside: and it must be allowed that l)
the Greeks certainly, most probably the Egyptians, knew the ad-
vantage of oil as a vehicle for pigmentS. ,,

In the MS. from Mount Athos a recipe for preparing a drying <
oil 1s given. The oil intended is most likely linseed, but I have '
not been able to trace the origin of the word Πεζῆρι, Peseri·.
“ How to prepare peseri.’

“ Take peseri and put it into a large metal basin3 expose it to κζ’
an ardent sun forty days. Take care, however, not to allow it to
