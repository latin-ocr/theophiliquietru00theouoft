were superposed. The term was retained while the process
changed, and hence the different coloured fiuids used for painting
or writing, and which were, in either case, laid on with pencils,
were still called “ encausta.”¹ The word ‘⁴ atramentum” has been
similarly perverted. Originally representing a dax-k colour or
fluid, it gradually was used to denote different coloured fluids or
“ inks’' used for various purposes ².

The fabrication of ink by means of “ Roman vitriol’' (sulphate
of iron) and oak bark, (tannic acid,) is of more recent origin,
probably a· century or two before the Christian era.

Sir H. Davy, “ on the Papyri in the Museum of Naples,'’
writes—“ I looked in vain amongst the MSS. and in the animal

’ charcoal surrounding them for vestiges of letters in oxide of iron,

and it would seem from these circumstances, as well as from the
omission of any mention of such a substance by Pliny, that the
Romans, up to his period, never used the ink of galls and iron for
writing. And it is very probable that the adoption of this ink and
the use of parchment took place at the same time3 for the inl<
composed of charcoal and a solution of glue can scarcely be made
to adhere to the skin, whereas the free aeid of the chemical ink
partly dissolves the gelatine of the M S„ and the whole substance
adheres as a mordant.” ³

This is not certain; Pliny gives a mode for detecting sulphate
of iron in sulphate of copper by the infusion of galls upon paper;
he says “it instantlff¹ blackens.” 4

Davy appears to have overlooked the following passage in Pliny,
which shows that aeid inks were known before his time. “ Omne
autem atramentum sole perficitur, librarium gummi, tectorium
glutino admixto. Quod autem aceto liquefactum est, aegre
eluitur.''⁵·

Atramentum is mentioned by Theophilus towards the close of
this chapter. Whether the “atramentum librarium’' of Diosco-
rides, composed of three ounces of soot with one ounce of gum, (see
Dioscor. v. 183, Περὶ μέλανος,) was intended, or the sulphate of iron,
green vitriol, “ atramentum tectorium” of the Romans, is open to
