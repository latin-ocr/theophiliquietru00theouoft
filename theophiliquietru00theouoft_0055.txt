PREFACE. xxxvii

But “ de pictura satis superque‚’-’ and my labours are
drawing to a close. In my notes I have offered such
explanations of the terms used by Theophilus as the

limits affor-ded me will allow; I hope that the reader will
not find them' misplaced.

An increasing taste is obtaining for the beautiful and
spirited works of art belonging to the middle ages, for
things which the last century abandoned to contempt
and neglect: the important works which have lately
been undertaken in this country, and which are pro-
bably destined to increase, render an apology for the in-
troduction of this book needless3 information upon
these subjects is every where sought, and an opportu-
nity is affordedj for the instruction of the artist and
artizan, as much needed in our time as in that of our

author. The prospect of the general diffusion and em-
ployment of art in our English Protestant cathedrals

Sayd, one of the conditions of the peace, concluded at the com-
mencement of the eighth century between the Caliph Valid and
the Greek Emperor, was, that the latter should furnish a certain
quantity of ‘⁶ fsefysa ” for the decoration of the Mosque of Damas-
cus, which the caliph was then constructing. (Notice upon the Worlcs
os M. de I'rangey, Journal Asialique, An. 1842,p. 9, 10.) The same
word, “ ψῆφοι,” is found in the Athos MS. (loc. cit.) to designate
mosaics. “ But,” writes M. Didron, “ these are mosaics in glaSS,
transparent‚ with golden grounds, as the words 6ψήφοις χρυσέοις·
indicate: these are the mosaics which cover the vaults‚ cupolas,
and a part of the walls of St. Sophia of Constantinople‚ of St.
Sophia of Salonica, of Vatopedi and of St. Laura of Mount Athos,
of Daphne near Athens, of St. Luke in Livadia‚ of the round
temples of Salonica andos Ravenna. BIosaic is Byzantine and
Christian, and the Arabs, who⁵⁴ have merely a borrowed architec-
ture‚ have even borrowed a great portion of their embellishment.”
The word “mosaic'' was most probably derived from the word
“mosque,” for the adornment of which the Byzantine Greeks were
much employed in producing these cubic glass stones.
