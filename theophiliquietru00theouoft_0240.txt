C. XIII. AND C. XIV. “VITRUM CLARISSIMUM, VELUT
CRYSTALLUM, QUOD IPSI COMPONUNT.''

The “very clear glass like crystal” used by the Greeks, in
order to attach gold leaf to vases, and which in C. xiv. is employed
upon an ornament of gold, or silver, previously laid upon glass, is
no other than a flux capable of retaining and combining, by the
action of fire, with the various vitreous colouring substances after-
wards superposed. This last chapter indeed proves that the
Byzantine Greeks practised the art of PArn‘rrNG uror< Gnass, an
art which all the French writers, from Le Viel to M. E. Thibaud,
with perhaps a laudable partiality‚ labour to prove of French
origin, and of the twelfth or thirteenth century.

Emeric David¹ indeed, in exception, mentions that the historian
of the monastery of St. Begnine, who wrote about 1052, declares

that there existed, yet in his time, in the church of the monastery,
a very ancient glass window, representing the martyrdom of St.

Paschasie, and that this painting had been taken from the old
church, restored by Charles the Bald, (A. D. 850,) ‘⁶ ur QUAEDAM
vrrREA ANTIQUITiJs FAcrA, et usque ad nostra perdurans tempora,
eleganti praemonstrabat picturas

The Benedictines have ascribed this invention to the period qf
Charlemagne, T. 6, p. 66, and with more reason. For Theo-
philus not only describes the ornamenting of cups, vases, and
other utensils, by means of coloured glass fluxed upon a white
ground; but in C. 21 are found clear directions for painting upon
glass. “ In the same manner you make grounds of the clearest
white, the figures of which grounds you ornament with sapphire,
green, purple, and red.'' The dark colour is to take the place of
posc in marking the nude, διο.

Traces of a flux for the purpose of ornamenting vases, whether
of glass or earthenware, are found scattered through the books of
Eraclius. The art of rendering glass more fusible by means of
litharge was well known to that writer.
