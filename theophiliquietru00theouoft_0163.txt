had painted a Conversion of St. Paul in fresco, a picturevof three
metres in breadth and four in height. Twelve personages and
three large horses occupied this rather extensive field. This
painting was certainly not a masterpiece, but it was better than
that which would cost one of our painters, of the second order,
from six to eight months. I even doubt that our great painters,
charged with a religious composition, would execute it more uni-
formly well ; there would be more excellencies, but more faults
also in their work than in the fresco of Mount Athos.

“When the picture is finished, they wait until the lime has
almost entirely dried3 they then finish the figures. They attach
gold and silver to the nimbus and to garments, they enrich the
paintings with the finest colours, particularly Venetian azure, and
they make the flowers and ornaments which decorate the interior
of the nimbus, the stuffs of habits, the ground of the picture.
For this, the grosser colours, which were used to paint the figures,
must be very dry, so that they may neither spoil the precious
colours, nor the silver or gold. The figure finished, it is named.
A special artist‚ a writer, inserts the name of the personage in the
field or nimbus, or about it: he traces upon the cartel which the
figure holds, patriarch, prophet, judge, king, apostle, or saint,
the consecrated legend, which the¹ ‘guide of painting' com-
mands. Afterwards it is not touched, all is finished.

“This is what I observed with the greatest care in the church of
Esphigmenou, of Mount Athos. While the painter was at work
Ι interrogated him, and wrote upon the spot, and as under his
dictation, what I saw and heard. They scarcely ever paint in oil,
because, said Father Joasaph, to paint in oil we must wait until the
plaster has become dry, and, as the colour would not penetrate
into the lime, it would be less solid.”

From these extracts it will be seen that sand or silica is dis-
pensed with in the composition of the stucco, the peculiar action
of which, by hastening the setting of the plaster, so much annoys
the fresco painter. The binding of the lime is produced by me-
chanical means, instead of the chemical action which the process
of Vitruvius and the later Italians undergoes; this would, by re-
tarding the setting of the canent, obviate the necessity of picce-
meal work, which is not spoken of in the Athos MS. The
