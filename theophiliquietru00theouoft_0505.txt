The four rivers of Paradise “in human form‚’' and the Evange-
lists “in figures of animals‚” are a remnant of the iconography of
this period.

The Athos manuscript shows us how the Greeks, in the twelfth
century, represented the Evangelists; these representations‚ pro-
bably, date from the middle of the ninth century, when art began
to recover from the effects of the persecution suffered by the
Greek painters owing to the proscription of religious images
pronounced by Leo the Isaurian. This persecution lasted about
1⁵0 years ¹.

Saint Luke, young, crisped hair, little beard, writing “ Foras-

⁴ The 'retramorphe is tho union of the four attributes of the evangelista in one
figure, one body united to four heads. 'l'he angel of St. Matthew, the eagle of St.
John, the lion of St. Mark, and the bull of St. Luke, have the heads grouped upon
a-winged human body, the four gospels forming one. The Tetramorphe, says M.
Didron, is mely seen in the iconography of the western church‚ but is frequent in

the Greek. ‘rm-goi pogQA—four-form. Γ F o
