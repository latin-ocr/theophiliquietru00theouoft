ornaments were introduced into Rome ¹3 probably from the latter
cause.

Eraclius, “De Artibus Romanorum‚” is the only author, with
the exception of Theophilus, who makes mention of “ vitrum
gallienum ;” and, fortunately, his chapter upon this subject is not
lost to us². After describing the manufacture of white glass‚
Eraclius proceeds to direct the colouring of it.

“ Si vero vis ut efficiatur rubeum de cinere tamen³ bene cocto
sic facies.”

“But should you wish to make a red from the ‘ashes‚’ well
cooked, however, you aet thus. Take the filing of copper, and
burn it until it becomes powder, and place it into the small vessels
of glass, and it will become a red glass‚ which we call Gallien:'’
“ quem Gallienum vocamus.’'

The “ Gallien,” then, was the deep carmine-coloured glass pro-
cured from a protoxide of copper, which is now generally flashed
upon a white glass, as, unless worked as soon as the red colour
appears, it becomes of a tint too intense, to be serviceable.

The MS. Sloane, 1754, already quoted, fol. 153, contains a
recipe for a red glass.

‘⁶ If you wish to make beautiful, clear, and shining red stones,
take 100 drachms of your cristal,” and two and a half drachms of
black oxide of iron, (magnesia ferrea,) this is the magnetic stone
which attracts iron; (ce est une pyere ke est aymant si tret fer 3)
place it to cook for five days and five nights in the pot, then with-
draw the fire and allow it to cool.''

Pliny also mentions this protoxide of iron for the purpose of
staining glass. “Caeptus addi et magnes lapis3 quoniam in se
liquorem vitri quoque, ut ferrum, trahere creditur.'’‘¹

the “ cinis’' of Eraclius is the heated mixture of sand and potash.
