Canepmius, “De ¹Atramentis,” p. 300, writes—

“Ex Vernice, (Sandaracha Arabum,) et oleo ex semine lini,
fit liquida vernix.”

The two processes given by Theophilus would form, owing to
the peculiar nature of the resin, two different varnishes. By
the first process the resinous portion alone of this gum resin would
be dissolved, unless the boiling were continued for a very long
time, so as at last to raise the heat to a high degree, in order to
keep the oil at the simmering point, which becomes higher in pro-
portion to the loss of the more volatile portions of the oil, which
it will be remembered are allowed to escape, “ until a third part
is consumed.'’ The varnish, however, is not perfected by the first
process, and is osa very dark colour. By the second process the
whole of the resin may be incorporated with the oil at once and the
long boiling is not required, nor does Theophilus prescribe it.
The word “bullire,” is used by our author in opposition to
“coquere,” the latter having the signification of “to seeth,”
the former “to boil violently‚'' as “aestuo ” “ferveo‚” against the
danger of which he cautious the artist.

The true Arabian sandarac is stated by Schousboe¹‚ a Danish
traveller, to be produced by the thuia articulata, which is a cy-
press.' It i's called “el grassa.” The juniper cypress does not
grow in Africa. Dr. Ure gives an analysis of this gum-resin.
“Spec. gr. 1.05 to 1.09. It contains three resins, one soluble in
alcohol, somewhat resembling pinic aeid or turpentine resin, one
not soluble in that liquid, and a third soluble only in alcohol of
90 per cent.’'

The following are taken from the MS. from Mount Athos.
These varnishes are of the twelfth century.

“ Take PesEri which you have baked in the sun, one hundred
drachmas, and white resin, seventy-five drachmas. Place them
in a pot upon a fire, so as to melt and combine these two substances
together. Filter, and employ this varnish in exposing it to the
