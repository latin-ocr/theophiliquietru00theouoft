ing is slightly traced and the picture sketched. The compass
serves principally for the nimbus, the heads, and the circular parts3
the rest is traced with the hand, which is only armed with a small
brush (pinceau.) In less than an hour, Father J oasaph had traced
before us an entire picture, in which figured Christ and his Apos-
tles, of the natural size; he made this sketch {entirely from idea,
without any hesitation, carton or model, and without even looking
at the figures already painted by him in other neighbouring pic-
tures. I did not see him efface or rectify a single line, so sure was
he of his hand. He commenced by sketching the principal per-
sonage, Christ, who was in the midst of his Apostles. He made
first the head, then the remainder of the figure in descending.
Then he drew the first Apostle on the right, then the first on the
left, then the second on the right and left, and so the others, sym-
metrically. The painter traced his sketches, his hand raised and
without using a rest ‚· this instrument, used by our painters, would
enter the still humid plaster. However, the hand is rested upon
the wall itself when it trembles‚ or is fatigued.

“Inside this red line, which defines the outline of the figureS‚ an
inferior painter spreads a black ground ¹, which he relieves with
blue, but in a tint as flat as the black ground itself. Itis upon
this field that this painter, a kind of practitioner, designs the
draperies and other ornaments. As to the nude, he does not
touch it; that is reserved for the master. All the draperies are
made, and the circular line of the nimbus is traced, before the
head, the feet, and the hands.

“ The master then takes this sketched figure, and forms the head.
He spreads at two different times a couch of blackish colour,
(noirfitre‚) over all the face, and fixes the outline of the face with
a colour still deeper. He paints two faces at once, going in-
cessantly from one to the other, to exhaust all the colour con-
tained in the pencil; the colour of one head must likewise have
time to be imbibed into the wall while the second is preparing.
Then with a yellow colour he makes the forehead, cheeks, neck,
and the flesh parts. A first couch of yellow extinguishes the

¹ This “ black ground ’' must be the proplasm, which, while wet, would appear
quite black. The mixture of blue would prepare for the half tints, as in this pro-
cess the lights are graduated into the shadows, passing over the prepared half tint.
An improvement upon the practice of Theophilus, and of later date.
