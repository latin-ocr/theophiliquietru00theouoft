CHAPTER XVII.

OF FILES.

FnAEs are made from pure steel‚ large and moderately sized,
triangular and round. Others also are made which are
stronger in the middle, from soft iron inside‚ but outwardly
they are covered with steel; which, when they have been
beaten to the size which the maker wishes to give them, are
made smooth upon a planinginstrument, and are thus marked
out with a hammer, which is sharp on both sides. They are
also marked out with the cutting iron, of which we have
spoken above, with which the work, which has previously
been filed with the other larger irons, should be smoothed.
And when they have been cut all over, make their tempering
in this way.

CHAPTER XVIII.

01⁴* TEMPERING ΡΙ LEs .

BURN the horn of an ox in the fire, and serape it, and mix
with it a third part salt, and grind it strongly. Then put the
file in the fire, and when it glows sprinkle this preparation
over it everywhere, and, some hot coals being applied, you
will blow quickly upon the whole, yet so that the tempering
may not fall off, and quickly withdrawing it¹, extinguish it
equally in water, and taking it out, dry it slightly over-the
fire. You will in this manner temper all things which are
made of steel.

CHAPTER XIX.

THE SAME AS THE PRECEDING.

ΜΑΚΕ also smaller files, similarly square, round, triangular,
thin, from soft iron, and you will thus temper thern. When
