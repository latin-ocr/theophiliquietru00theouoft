and if by some negligence it should vhappen that the melted
silver be not whole, cast it again until it is made whole ¹. [Then
make the mixture from clear lye and salt, in which you
quench the silver as often as you remelt it.]

CHAPTER XXVI.

ΟΕ MAKING THE SMALLER CHALICE-

AND when you have begun to beat it, find the middle of it,
and mark a centre with the compass, and around it make a
square projection, in which you should fasten the foot. But
when it has been made so thin that it can be bent with the
hand, make circles inside with the compass from the centre
to the middle, and outside, from the middle to the rim, and
with a round hammer beat it inside according to the circles,
that thus it may acquire depth, and outside with a middle-
sized (hammer) upon a round anvil according to the circles
as far as the rim, that it may thus become more narrow, and
do this until at length you attain for it a form and capacity
according to the quantity of silver. Which being done, rasp the
inside and out smoothly with a file, and round the mouth until it
is made even throughout. Then divide the remaining half of the
silver in two, as above, and from one portion take away the
weight of six nummi, and add it to the other from which you
make the foot, which afterwards in filing you will take away
from it and restore to its portion. And thus cast an'd hammer
the foot, as the cup, until it is at length thinned, excepting that
you do not make a projection in it. Being thinned you will
give it depth, inside and out, with the round hammer, and will
begin to form the knot with the middle-sized hammer upon
the round anvil, and then upon one lengthened upon both sides,
until you make the neck as slender as you wish‚ having a
careful regard to this, that you do not hammer more in one
place than in another, that the knot may not by chance lean
upon either side, but stand in the middle, everywhere equally
thick and wide. Then place it upon the coals and fill it with
