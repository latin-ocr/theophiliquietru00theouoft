184 NOTES To BOOK 11.

When admitted to Caesar he held out the jar to him, who, angry,
threw it upon the pavement‚ where it bent like a brass vase. The
artificer raised the jar from the floor, thrust a small hammer into
the cavity‚ and mended the jar. This done, Caesar asked the
artificer whether any other person knew this tempering for glass,
and when he denied, with an oath, that any other knew of it,
Caesar ordered him to be decapitated; lest, this known, gold and
silver might become as clay, and the value of all metals be debased.
For, in truth, did glass vessels not break they would be better

than gold or silver.’'
We see that the relation of Pliny has been much improved, and

that Isidore has perpetrated, or perpetuated, an error which gave
much trouble to many an alchemist of the middle ages.

Pliny, L. 29, c. 3, gives us the process usually followed in his
time for cementing broken glass, “ candidum ex his (ovis) admis-
tum calci vivae glutinat vitri fragmenta3 ” “white osan egg, mixed
with quick—-lime‚ glues together the fragments of glass.”

 

DE COMPONENDIS FENESTRIS.

Of the use of coloured glass by the ancients it has been shown
that we have proof. The enamelled charms, (abracadabra‚) and
the “ abaculi ” of the Greeks and Romans, yet in existence, show
this. The Romans employed glass in the embellishment of their
apartments, and Seneca appears to intend that mirrors were em-
ployed for this purpose, as at the present day. “ Pauper sibi vi-
detur ac sordidus, nisi parietes magnis et pretiosis orbibus refulse-
runt, nisi vitro absconditur camera.” Epist. 86 ¹.

¹ See Diodorus Siculus. Vol. 1, p. 163. II. Wesseling. Who tells us that in a
country near Egypt variously coloured crystal is made by “ divine fire.“ (ὁτὲ

θείου πυραῖς.)
