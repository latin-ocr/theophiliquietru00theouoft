X PREFACE.

upon the arts and the sciences. Gerbert, afterwards
Pope Silvester IL, was educated in the schools of the
Arabs, in Spain, in the tenth century, and acquired
their language. Less inventive than practical in science,
the Arab writers appear to have accumulated the ex-
perience of preceding authors rather than made new
discoveries, to have instructed rather than progressed.
The simple character of the early sciences of the far
east, with the speculative philosophy of the west,
appear to have been united to afford them their know-
ledge. The Caliphs Harfin-al-Rashid and Al-Mamfin
were philosophers and scientific men3 they caused the
Greek classics to be translated into Arabic ; from them
the writings of the Arab physicians are principally
drawn. The mystic doctrine of the neo-Platonic school
of Alexandria, eminently qualified to captivate the
ardent imagination of the Arabs, was adopted by them ;
they attributed to the science of alchemy the art
of transmuting the metals into gold and the universal
panacea ¹. Geber, their most famous chemist, who
appears to have lived in the eighth century, as he is
quoted by the Arab writers of the ninth, restored
alchemical science to its true nature, and thereby
earned the title of the father of chemistry. Geber has
the credit of making known the process of distillation
by a simple description, although this art had been for
centuries described in the books of the initiated ².
