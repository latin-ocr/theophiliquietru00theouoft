That the Sapphire (or lapis lazuli) was employed in order to
colour glass of a rich blue, I hope to be enabled to show, and that
this was the substance which produced the fine and peculiar tints
both in glass and enamel, there will be no reason in many instances
to doubt; may the artist sueceed in reproducing these, and in re-
covering a lost branch of his art.

The Byzantine MS. given by Muratori is silent upon the sub-
ject of a blue glass.

Eraclius informs us, after having directed the manufactum of a
glass of silica fluxed with lead, “ De isto vitro plumbeo, ille sci-
licet qui coeruleus est, qui de duobus coloribus potest fieri, poteris
si vis cum pulvere saphireo miscere ad pingendum in vitro-”—
“ From this lead glass, that one namely which is blue, which can
be made of two colours, you can mix, if you wish, SAPPHIRE
powder for painting upon glass.’' ³ Again,

sapphire), and you mix lead glass‚ with judgment, and you grind
it strongly upon an iron slab, and it can thus be painted with.”

Eraclius mentions “ Lazur ” in a composition for colouring
earthenware vases of a dark hue 3 this is noticed elsewhere as pro-
bably a preparation from copper or cobalt.

somewhat differs from the Trinity College MS„ although, in substance, similar.
