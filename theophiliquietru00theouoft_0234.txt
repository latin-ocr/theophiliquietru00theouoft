“ Take two ounces of fine crystal and balsan ounce of calcined
copper, χαλκοῦ κεκαυμένου, grind these substances in a mortar, and
melt them together by an equal fire, ’ἴσῳ πυςι.”

In the Byzantine MS. given by Muratori, already referred to,
the composition ofa green glass is found, p. 370¹.

dients, mixed with lead.
