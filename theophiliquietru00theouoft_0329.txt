you rub the niello, wetted with saliva, caresully and smoothly
everywhere, until all the drawings are plainly seen, and it is
quite smooth. You also have a piece of wood from the lime
tree‚'of the length and thickness of the smallest finger, dry
and smoothly cut; upon which you place this wet powder,
which comes from the stone and saliva in rubbing, and with
this wood and the same powder you rub the niello a long
time, and lightly, and always add saliva, that it may be wet,

until it is made brilliant everywhere. Then take wax from .

the hollow of your ear, and when you have wiped the niello
clean with a fine linen eloth, you anoint it everywhere, and
with goat or hart's skin you will lightly rub it until it is made
quite bright.

THE handles being completely finished in this manner, take
the cup of the chalice, the ribs of which you have already
blackened one half, and file and serape those parts which
you have alternatively l'eft without niello, and portray
upon them whatever work you wish‚ so, however, that it
may somewhat differ from all the niello work, and with a
slender sculping iron you will carve it very finely. You will
afterwards gild them, and all the vase inside and outside, the
niello excepted, and you will polish and colour them like the
handles. Then you cover a round anvil, and you will bind
it round with smooth parchment, over which you place the
cup, which the boy sitting before you can hold with both
hands, adjusting each rib to the anvil evenly, according to
what you may order him. In the mean time take a fine in-
strument which has a hole at the point, by the blow of which
you produce a very fine circle, and you will fill up all the
grounds in the gilt ribs with it, striking lightly upon it with a
hammer, and joining successively each circle to the other
with punched work. This being accomplished, place the cup

over the coals until these strokes receive a yellow colour in—
