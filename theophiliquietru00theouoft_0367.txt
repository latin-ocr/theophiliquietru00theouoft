TRANsnArmN. 297

In the lower part a wider border will be formed, the angles
being likewise cut in form of a cross, that it may be fitted to
the upper, and a lower border is defined around. These
being thus adjusted, take two pieces of wood a foot in length
and the thickness which„you wish the wax to posseSS, and
another wood of equal length, round and thick as the stem
of a lance 3 and you will have a small tablet a foot wide and
two yards long and very smooth; upon this you fix the two
pieces of wood before mentioned, so that being separated
from each other by the space of half a foot, wood may be
evenly adjusted against wood. Then take pure wax which,
placed near the fire, you will strongly pound, and, thus warm,
you will place it upon the table between the two woods,
water being first applied that they may not adhere3 and pass-
ing over it the wetted round wood strongly with both hands,
you will thin it according to the thickness of the pieces of
wood. And when you have prepared many even pieces of
wax, sitting near the fire, cut them small according to the
spaces which you had cut in the clay of the censer, and you
will adjust to each space its piece slightly warmed, and with
an iron, fit for this work, and made warm, you will solder it
round. And when you have covered in this manner all the
“ nuclei '² outside, take a thin iron‚ sharp on both sides like a
slender arrow with a small handle, fixed in a wooden handle,
and with this cut it round everywhere, and you will smooth it
with box-wood made in the same fashion, and you will take
care that the vwax be in no place thicker or thinner than in
another. Then portray single arches in each front and the
like upon the side walls, and single folding ‘doors under each
arch on every side, so that each folding door may cover a
fourth part of the space, and that two parts may remain in
the middle3 in these spaces under each arch, you trace single
figures of the apostles‚ each of which may hold a writing of
the pattern you wish3 you will write their names in the border
around the arches. In the triangular spaces, which support
the pinnacles of the roof, you will fashion a representation of
twelve stones, distributing a proper stone to each apostle ac-
cording to the signification of its name 3 the names of these
