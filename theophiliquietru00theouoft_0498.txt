Jesus (lucore), Ic. In effect the second finger, remaining open,
indicates I (iota), and the third forms, by the curve, a C (sigma).
The thumb is placed across the fourth finger3 the fifth is likewise
a little bent, which forms an indication of the word (XPICTOC) XC3
for the meeting of the thumb and the fourth finger forms a X
(chi), and the little finger forms, by its curve, a C (sigma). These
two letters are the abridgment of Cnmsros. Thus, through the

‘⁸ The western Church,” writes M. Didron, “is less mystic. The
benediction is made in opening the three first fingers of the right
hand, and in keeping the annulary and the little finger shut. It
is true that certain liturgists‚ Guillaume Durand, amongst others,

and Ι, perhaps, imperfectly saw it. It is possible that a Greek
benediction may be met with amongst us3 such a fact should be
established with the utmost care, as incontestably proving a By-
zantine influence. M. Aymard has found, in the cathedral at
Puy, a hand blessing in the Greek manner. ‘⁴ This church,’' says
M. Didron‚ “ is vaulted with cupolas, as a Byzantine church, and
proves that the ancient churches with cupolas are really Byzan-
tine, although not the only ones.”

The beauty of the chalice, designed by Theophilus, will not
escape the attention of the artist, nor will the value of the recom-
mendation to “carve with a bold stroke '’ in the preparation of
the ground for the “ niello ” be lost. The value of this and the

26th chapters will be seen ΒΥ those who will take the trouble to
compare them with the readings of all other copies of the MS.
